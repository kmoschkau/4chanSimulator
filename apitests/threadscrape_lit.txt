ITT: Post your most elitist literary opinions
i honestly believe if things were fair then a tax would be levied against plebs to transfer wealth from them to me and everyone on this board to finance our shitposting and reading because we&#039;re superior beings that need our solitude and it&#039;s an injustice for us to even have to be in the same room as a philistine
read the books /lit isn&#039;t talking about.
That alone makes it more involved than a painting which anyone with eyes can see.
The only books being published today that are of literary value come out of Eastern European countries.
James Joyce, Vonnegut, and Steinbeck are the most entry level classic writers.
Is this worth reading, /lit/?

Only in its original Spanish. Hit the books, gringo.
Yes
Speaking of learning spanish. I&#039;m studying it right now. Any recommendations for good books to learn with?
on your death bed you will regret the two weeks it took to read this book. it is definitely not worth it. choose instead to do something meaningful with these two weeks.

Yes, this is easily my favorite book I have ever read. The first few hundred pages drag on a little, but the last hundred pages or so give you the ability to reanalyze the part about the critics. I would talk about the themes but i&#039;d rather not spoil anything, just go into it and pay attention to when the prose changes.
Just get the audiobook if you&#039;re a pansy

20The Waves by Wooolf. It&#039;s so so so so good. Picked it up on a whim and it&#039;s spectacular, my first by Woooolf
A ton of Descartes for final paper

18It&#039;s bretty good
it&#039;s not the best place but w.e

Really good. The entertainment I get out of it goes up and down in some parts but overall its a great book. Currently halfway through book three and hoping to finish by Christmas. I&#039;ve got AK and Demons by Dosto to read next but i&#039;m getting worn out by so many long ass books.
I started reading for study purposes but I&#039;m really enjoying it so far
It&#039;s accessible and engaging, about the opposite of what I assumed it&#039;d be. I feel I have pretty much no reason to keep putting off reading when it&#039;s so fun.
It&#039;s fucking amazing.
19i have like 240 books and i don&#039;t know what to start next. What should i pick? something short preferably. just say a book and i probably have it

I really like it. The only book by Larry Niven I haven&#039;t enjoyed so far was A World Out of Time and the first half of Ringworld.
Its ambitious but his crystal clear prose and having already studied the Napoleonic wars make it easier

Enjoying it quite a lot. /lit/ wasn&#039;t memeing about the quality of the prose. The fact that it manages to be uncomfortably sexual without any vulgarity is impressive too.
It makes me angrier than it should.
20 next weekDon Quixote part 2. First part was a relaxing read, even the monologues. I&#039;m just hoping part 2 is as comfy and Sancho gets his insula. Getting some Gogol for Christmas so looking forward to going full russian lit for a few months after this

It&#039;s pretty good, I like Orwell&#039;s style in it, interested to read from where he has to deal with republican infighting.
Moby Dick. About 300 pages in. Loving it so far. I was led to believe it was largely boring cetology, but even the cetology chapter was lively and beautifully written. The characters are phenomenal.
It&#039;s all downhill from there. :^)


Hmm. I&#039;ll wait a while before I read anything else then. Wait til I forget how good it is.
19It&#039;s a big ol&#039; meme but I am really enjoying it stylistically. It is probably unnecessarily slow but I am really interested to see where it goes.
20I feel like I&#039;m rushing through it because of the length of the sentences. Wild Palms wasn&#039;t full of these, but I don&#039;t mind the style
ilm feeling angry at these vain, soulless richfags

21The Design of Everyday Things, just finished Cryptonomicon.
To the Lighthouse is also phenomenal. Much less ambitious than The Waves but still formally innovative and full of beautiful passages. I say give it a read if you are liking The Waves
Am I an edgy teen or a meme if I identify with the narrtor? The first part, at least, was pretty close to my own thoughts and experience.

19Reading all of McCarthy, enjoying it so far
Reading the Iliad in translation is like listening to Beethoven&#039;s 9th played on a piano.

18They&#039;re all pretty good so far, got them from the library to try to make sense of everything I&#039;ve been feeling lately.

22The theme is interesting, The Victor Hugo&#039;s aphorisms and comparisons are really good too. It&#039;s been a great experience.


20It&#039;s pretty interesting. Reading about how the markets would freak out just because Ben added an adjective in the slightly wrong place is both hilarious and frightening.
Get well soon


27I don&#039;t understand a fucking word but it&#039;s fun
It&#039;s fantastic. It&#039;s like it&#039;s opened my eyes to what good prose is, because it functions on a whole different level to the other stuff I&#039;ve read up until now.

I feel like reading some good horror type stuff set in new england, I&#039;ll check out some of kings other books too.
central europe though
I liked the stand until he introduced some bullshit spirit stuff. I quit then, it just felt out of place with the rest of the book, Introduced so quickly.
i fucking love pineapple

Yeah man, it is pretty &quot;symptomatic,&quot; to say the least...
22Nearly 200 pages in and I&#039;m really loving it so far.
23About 40 pages in and not enjoying it so far. Prose is flat and there&#039;s not too much going on. Might drop it soon.
well yeah unless you are dying of stomach cancer its not directly relatable but if that&#039;s your criticism then you are a certified plebian

22Very nice phenomenology of stuffs (selfs, authors and characters)
Pretty boring but informative. Started to work my way through the complete Icelandic sagas. (As complete as it gets in Swedish at least) Expect it to get better once I get to the actual sagas as the ones I&#039;ve read before are kinda cool.
30. Canada. C&amp;P. Its good. Real good.
Yes the chapter with the nigger lady in nebraska was boring as hell, I&#039;m at the part where everybody meets in Boulder, but the dreaming together shit is getting kind of dull, I just like the end of the world travelling and surviving stuff, I&#039;ve read some of Kings other books before and some of them also had a way of getting too long in parts and having a shit ending.
Not that I don&#039;t like it so far, the character is a bit relatable and I&#039;m anxious to see how his journey ends.

20 It&#039;s a very enjoyable read. I understand why people call it Pynchon lite now.
19It&#039;s so comfy
I&#039;m enjoying it, only have 50 pages left.
Liking them all so far. Bout halfway into the first two and only 3 chapters into The Bell Jar.
18I like it a lot. I decided to start reading again just like i did when i was younger.

Homosexuals always pushed for the dismemberment of the status quo in the sense that their lifestyles are uncompatible with traditional values. The real danger of homosexuals is not who they fuck but how do they poison the minds of others through vicious practices like child molesting, excessive hedonism and normalization of STDs amongst other things.
I&#039;m sure you can find many books on Feudalism. It&#039;s basically the same thing.

That&#039;s anarcho capitalism; gold coins, war, treason, invasion, defeat and an old book about the rulers of a kingdom of whoms descendants don&#039;t even know what happened.

If you really fear hedonism you better drop the pretence of liberalism, traditional values have been crumbling as a result of the spread of liberalism primarily
It&#039;s all back to the whole thick vs. thin libertarian thing, where I guess I would also call thick libertarians (cosmotarians, hoppe and the conservatarians) &quot;utopians&quot; to some extent where they think the voluntary society would match their values perfectly, which cannot happen and should not happen.
the Ancap wants to be fash soo hard but he&#039;s too much of a bowtie pussy bitch to admit it.
I&#039;m new to literature and just finished this and wanted to talk about it. Here are some of my observationsIt feels to me like, above anything, it&#039;s a very well-designed story. The way that events and characters tie together feels more natural than any other story I&#039;ve ever read, and it has the effect of a constant stream of emotional moments. It&#039;s really impressive, and it&#039;s interesting that other books seem to focus more on the style/prose and less on actually making the story interesting. Because it&#039;s not focused on style, it seems like the sort of thing some /lit/ posters would call pleb, but it&#039;s part of the western canon and it still focuses on ideas and philosophy as much as story. I guess I just don&#039;t understand the fetish of style

I don&#039;t understand why you would spend the effort reading a novel like this when you display getting as much out of it as I do from an episode of a children&#039;s cartoon
lmao strong bait
be sure to read the epilogue
read Notes from the Underground for a better understanding of Raskolnikov&#039;s character
is accurate. You&#039;ll find that it&#039;s not only the philosophy and ideas that are in dialogue, it&#039;s the drama, too. Dostoevsky is very Homeric in this regard, and indeed he was inspired by Homer&#039;s poems. Both authors let their characters do the talking, which helps create a world of verisimilitude, which in turn lends credibility to the psychology of the characters (extremely important in both authors, as you no doubt noticed Raskolnikov&#039;s psychology shape throughout the book), which aids in creating the drama. One of the wonders of these two is that neither necessarily speaks directly at you with a character that expresses their own personal views. In Dostoevsky, for example, you have a wide variety of characters who may express some of the author&#039;s views, but never in full, and often times distorted to some degree. There is never the character of Dostoevsky in one of his novels, and he either took this from Homer or at least was influenced by it.
Crime and punishment is a fantastic book, newfriend. Dostoevsky actually wrote it in order to earn income and support his family. Even before completing the novel, he was already an illustrious writer. He understood what people wanted to read, and he simply appeased their interests. Not many other writers could tell a story as well as Dostoevsky could.
The point was that whatever you want to say about the philosophy which Dostoyevsky is getting at, he frames it around a story that is designed almost perfectly. I get the feeling that a lot of literature is so willing to meander that it ends up diluting the point, which doesn&#039;t happen here
haha whoa! really makes u think :)
You&#039;re right.

I can really tell you read the Garnett translation
Constructive!
Okay, how about this. Read anyone but Garnett. There&#039;s a reason Anglophones are bored by Russian lit, and she&#039;s it.
P&amp;V are boring too
Revised Garnett is the only option to go with. What are you a P&amp;Vedditor?
Okay, how about Coulson?
Literally who?
Garnett is the whole reason Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and others are adored by Anglophones. There&#039;s nothing boring about her translations of Dostoevsky.
if you ever read tolstoy (and you definitely should) i think it would do you good to pay attention to how tolstoy constructs and depicts his characters, versus how dostoevsky does them. tolstoy is generally regarded as the superior stylist and writer of &quot;better,&quot; or at least more realistic, characters.
Are you implying that Dostoevsky&#039;s characters don&#039;t have &quot;good characterization&quot; because they&#039;re caricatures? Or something else?
well it depends on your aesthetic sensibilities. the reason nabokov shat on dostoevsky so much was largely for this reason - that his characters are not necessarily &quot;human&quot; or &quot;aesthetic objects,&quot; but more &quot;mouthpieces&quot; for certain beliefs, and dostoevsky just plays them off each other in almost strawman-esque fashion at times. again, this is underselling what dostoevsky is doing, but i think one can see where this criticism comes from. dostoevsky&#039;s emotional impact comes from characters essentially distilling down their moral and ideological positions and &quot;feeding&quot; them to their interlocutors/the reader. tolstoy does this at points too, but it&#039;s a -much- smaller part of how he characterizes his characters, and gogol does this almost not at all, barring certain concluding/crucial narrative moments.
I understand this, I think the clarification though is that while Dostoevsky writes characters with a simplistic operating principle when it comes to describing the drives, reflections and passions of the characters he&#039;s amazingly profound.
I hope that makes sense.
dostoevsky&#039;s strengths are, as discussed here, in his ability to convey strong passions and emotions in an explosive and viscerally impactful way, which is to be admired as well.

There&#039;s hope for this board afterall
It&#039;s probably too minor of a distinction to focus on, anyway.
I&#039;ve been recommended Hadji Murat many times now, so I&#039;ll certainly get to it at some point. I do intend on reading War and Peace in the coming months and am very much looking forward to it. I anticipate liking the setting more than Anna Karenina, where the only things I sincerely enjoyed was Levin, especially Levin on his farm (and I wonder if this is, by your observations, a common theme of the new reader to Tolstoy). What is it about The Forged Coupon that you prefer over Hadji Murat?
 pointed out previously, the dialogue lends credibility to the psychology, but these dialogues are not the same kind of &quot;natural dialogue&quot; that one finds in everyday speech. so highly engineered is a good way to put it - just like homer (or might i suggest: plato?), dostoevsky characters are placed in very explicitly politically/philosophically charged situations, and react accordingly.
i preferred the brothers karamazov to this
the forged coupon is tolstoy&#039;s most panoramic book. this is probably strange to hear when considering the epic scope of AK, WP, and even Hadji Murat, spanning geographies and time; for me, as i mentioned, tolstoy&#039;s greatest strength is in his subtle and concise characterization, and it is this kind of panorama that&#039;s on full display in the forged coupon. it&#039;s a very brief work - 50 pages or so - and traces a single fake banknote altered by a schoolboy for a spur of the moment purchase, and it follows this banknote as it passes through the hands of dozens of characters. the coupon changes hands 20+ times in the span of 50 pages, and tolstoy manages to depict an entire range of human lives - from the modest to the greedy, the depths of depravity to the heights of innocence, and everything in between - and he does it by giving 1 - 2 pages to each single character. i think it&#039;s tolstoy at his most humanistic.
And this is where Homer comes in, who has his characters talk and talk and talk and then take some manner of action. That&#039;s how I see it, anyway.
Here&#039;s a question that might be difficult: do you have any tips for reading Tolstoy? Anything to look out for in general? Tolstoy is so renowned that ever since I read Anna Karenina and didn&#039;t really care for it, I&#039;ve been a little sad that I&#039;ve been missing out on the beauty that other people talk about, like you&#039;ve been doing. It&#039;s possible that he&#039;s just not for me (at the present), but I&#039;d like to make sure I at least gave him the shot he obviously deserves.
Camelia tu esti?
as for things to look out for, i would say maybe pay attention to his sentence constructions and -how- he reveals what he does about the characters (the order, the amount of detail, etc.). it falls under &quot;style&quot; which you stated you weren&#039;t too fixated on, but this is less prose style and more narrative technique. i don&#039;t think paying close attention to this is crucial to reading tolstoy, but it could be something that might help. no promises.
it also lends credence to starting with the greeks :^)
Is this the kind of thing you are talking about? Am I on the right track?
sure, and that&#039;s just largely paraphrasing/summarizing the action. i think it&#039;s interesting to think about how the reader feels the range of expression/shift in emotion that dolly feels &quot;concurrently&quot; - that is to say, we start with her in the middle of a messy room, without much emotional description (it&#039;s all setting), in a &quot;neutral&quot; state, and it is only after the sound of footsteps that descriptions of mood and feeling come in, and then we&#039;re taken through her fears in a pseudo free indirect discourse manner where we slip briefly into dolly&#039;s consciousness.
That&#039;s lovely. I think you&#039;re onto something here.
hehehe!
I&#039;m going to head to bed now. Perhaps I&#039;ll kickstart my Tolstoy reading with your recommendation tomorrow and then join in on the War and Peace group reading that starts on Saturday. You&#039;ve given me some truly valuable insight, so thank you. And thank you for the discussion.
passion is not lacking in realism. I worry that the real issue is what people think of realism, and how they perceive their fellow men, whether it be through subtleties or emotional outbursts. It&#039;s difficult to see what will make a character seem fake in a novel, and what things a reader will identify with.When it comes to a depiction of emotion, from what I&#039;ve seen, Tolstoy gives up the ghost and treats his characters as cardboard. When they need to be frenzied, they hardly show it. However, when his characters are at peace, it seems he has the advantage over the frantic Dostoevsky. Neither is the lesser author by merit of their impact on literature and people alone, but one might go so far to say that they appeal from two sides of the same coin. From what I&#039;ve seen, it&#039;s not so much age that makes a person appreciate Tolstoy more, necessarily, but rather balance in their minds between logic and emotion. whichever of the two has more influence in the person&#039;s mind will impact their sense of reality and identity with more weight. instead of direct analysis of the authors themselves, they should be used as mirrors to help us define ourselves, and to help us identify what pleases us, so that we may lead more fulfilling lives.
Nice post anon. I read C&amp;P a while ago and even tough I enjoyed it, most of the philosophical aspects (yes, I am aware this is a &quot;philosophical novel&quot;) of the book weren&#039;t that moving or impactful for me. Maybe it has to do with the fact that I abandoned my religious beliefs. But im curious, what did you think of the point dostoevsky was trying to make?
just read alyosha the pot. gosh, tolstoy was such a stick in the mud. never any life in that poor man. should have filled the pot up with life instead of cardboard.
Not a single complaint was expressed in the Op.
Anyway, I&#039;m eager for a second read-through (with a different translation) in a year or so.
Great post. I wonder, though, which author do you think is more related to logic, and which to emotion,and why?

IT IS MY PROPERTY!
Who is the sad vicious cunt that sits down and writes this garbage.
Good question
Good thread folks, I&#039;ve enjoyed the discussion.I&#039;ve since thought about who in my life resembles those characters and I can&#039;t think of anyone who is as extreme as Dmitri or pure/humble/loving as Alyosha. I can see now the criticism discussed itt that Dostoyevsky&#039;s characters are more like caricatures rather than humans.
I read Crime and punishment one year ago and it changed every concept that I had about literature. The Rodion&#039;s psychological and melancholic aspects through the book are amazing, it is the big point of Dosto’ book although there are greats characters and dialogs. I think I didn’t absorb all the questions involving that history, when I read I was starting in the literature universe and now I’m intending to read it again with more accurate eyes. Unfortunately I never read Tolstoi, I’d like to try war and peace but I don’t know what is the better translate in my country so I think it’s going to take time to start it.I’m new here and I have to congrats you, guys. Finally, I found an enjoyable thread and topic. Sorry for eventual mistakes, my English is a crap.
It&#039;s not really Homer pers se that he is trying to imitate. Dosotyevsky liked his dramas, Schiller was a really big influence so he oretty much apes his storytelling style from theater. That&#039;s why the dialogues take the foreground in his novels, more so than descriptions or interior monologues.
reading PV with its misplaced mechanical sounding translation really just ruins (or at least blunts his magic) dostoyevsky for a first timer.
I don&#039;t understand how you could even begin to think OP was saying that.
Your English is good. It&#039;s always nice to go back and re-read things after growing more. When I re-read Crime and Punishment I was able to see so much more in the story than my first reading, and that was my experience with everything by Dostoevsky that I&#039;ve read. Often with his works it can feel sort of suffocating and overwhelming because there&#039;s so much drama with the excitable characters, that you have difficulty sorting it all out. When you re-read it you get to see all of that again, but this time you&#039;re aware of them and get to focus more. Things aren&#039;t blindsiding you like they would be on a first reading.
You were definitely right about Tolstoy&#039;s greatest strength being &quot;in his subtle and concise characterization&quot;, and I think having so many characters related to each other, which can all be traced back to a forged note, brought that out, just because you get to see how the murderer is the one who goes on to rehabilitate Mitya more than a decade later, all because of that note. There were tons of little instances like this, like the investigating magistrate being Makhin, who begins ruminating on spirituality and so on after a run-in with someone else that is where they are because of the coupon. Great recommendation.
i shill forged coupon here all the time but only a few people have ever taken me up on it desu
Nice anime review mate.
It&#039;s the first time I&#039;ve ever seen it mentioned on this board, so I think you need to up your shilling.
Also, fuck off, the story paces like he wrote a dozen short stories and strung them together, the moment when a random dude in the bar outta nowhere grabbed him and told him his life story for no reason physically fucking pained me.
Dostoevsky&#039;s novels are like plays, not only dialogue but also how he describes things, the mannerisms of the &quot;actors&quot;, the &quot;sets&quot;, how he sets the scenes how he divides his novels in parts, very much like acts in a play. Crime and Punishment is almost as if it&#039;s narrated by someone watching a play.
Joyce&#039;s Ulysses being inspired by the Odyssey is the obvious example
uhhh winnie the pooh is selfish dick!
where they born the same day? is this canon?
Fuck off, casual
Fake quote! Pooh never said this.
Wait I don&#039;t get it
Fake news.Actually Pooh&#039;s (and everyone else&#039;s) selfless farewell to Christopher Robin is one of the saddest stories in literature. Welling up just thinking about it.
I&#039;m curious.
Oh the feels. Loss innocence, imagination etc.
Why&#039;d you have to remind me anon...

There are only two books and it&#039;s the one where he says goodbye forever. So take a guess.

This is a bad thread. Telling people your story ideas has no useful benefits as how it&#039;s told matters more than the ideas behind it, but will release the same brain chemicals that are released when you actually write the thing, so you&#039;ll lose your motivation to do the work.
And in depth examination and ultimate condemnation of mankind for not wanting to have sex with me.

You get those same brain chemicals through masturbating so it&#039;s better off everybody on /lit/ masturbates instead of posting in this thread
i had an idea about a book about a man who has become addicted to sex with fish in nearby koi pond who puts fish food under his foreskin and makes them suck it off, mainly because i thought it was ripe for descriptive ability, i already have &quot;his hot cock undulated with the gentle motion of the lake, leaving a smoky white cum trail which the large ornamental fish chased back and forth, in play&quot;
gorgeous
dunno how to end it tho
Would read. Probably would like it (depending on the quality of your prose). Would definitely hate you for that shitty ending.
r8
Originally he was going to kill himself but I figured that&#039;d be way too cliche. I don&#039;t want any real resolution, I just want something beyond his control to force him out of the vicious circle. The last image I have in my head is him carrying his sister on the other end of the Bay Bridge, looking back and seeing the city on fire
This plot is such modernist garbage.
This really made me think
Oh well
There&#039;s a machine which can redesign the universe to an optimal state and for a reason unexplained it can be activated only by the self-willing sacrifice of the nihilistic protagonist&#039;s life.
I&#039;m not sure how much exposition should go into chat with Ex and how much into solo MC wandering.
Would read if you toned down some of the meme parts, but I also love stories that don&#039;t really have a whole resolution

protagonist awake in cavernalso want to write about death rituals in eskimo communities with old peoples killing themselves once the tribe reach a particular number, very interesting stuff
I agree with you on stories with no resolutions. They seem so artificial to me. IRL people just carry on with their lives, slightly changed, there&#039;s never any resolution.
Any feedback is really appreciated!
Both are interesting. Good prose can carry these a long way.
Oh, you know, the two protagonists go out into the world and meet some people much like the ones you&#039;ll find in real life, and go through some common yet troubling social interactions that make me feel like we live in a society where nobody has any reason to care about one another anymore.Typical litfic garbage, I guess.
For every good there&#039;s a bad but not terrible
actually did the math on that one
You use the word &quot;all&quot; too much.
I didn&#039;t even notice all those alls. I&#039;ll take out the ones I don&#039;t need. Thanks!

 that the ending isn&#039;t very good. How would he react to the documentary actually being finished and released?
Have you seen The Witch (2015)? I&#039;d recommend it.
That&#039;s good dude. Would read.
Hey that&#039;s right up my alley. I&#039;ll probably watch it tomorrow, thanks!
That&#039;s the thing, I don&#039;t want the film to be released. I want all of the stored footage and the filmmaker to be lost in the fire, that&#039;s the only way I see the MC escaping the cycle the documentary ends up putting him in
It&#039;s good though. I&#039;m getting Birdman vibes from it .
 mah nigga

i like this, but I&#039;d only read it if you included a part about chopping the end of every boys penis off
sounds like a bit of an undertaking, have you considered collaborating?
Hope they come out well.
I like it so far. Seems like you have a style and it&#039;s an entertaining one. I would like to read how you write something human related. Do you have more anon?
Well, here&#039;s page two. I think most of it should be rewritten
Agree. Seems like some of the details you provide don&#039;t really add anything other than filler. Also seems like you did not put in same amout pf effort into this page. I think you should polish it. You have some talent anon. Keep writing and you could be onto something. Good luck anon
Yeah definitely not as much effort. I think if I can keep up the same tone from the first page it should be a lot better

I have an idea where a man decides to write about his life for his child in the form of music. Knowing the child won&#039;t just listen to stories about himself, he then creates 7 seven constellations in which he creates 8 stories (acts/albums)(7 different stories, and an epilogue revealing what the bigger picture of the stories was). Though each story follows a different character, several major themes and metaphors carry throughout the entirety of each story to ground them to each other. Each characters past and future will coincide with each other characters past and future, yet with entirely different settings, plots, stories. The 8th story reveals a secondary author who is different than the narrator and primary author for the rest of the stories. I don&#039;t want to go too much in detail because I don&#039;t trust 4Chan, but I think it&#039;ll be a great story/series of stories.
how about a book about a NEET who&#039;s trying to escape from nihilism but he doesn&#039;t know how
cant tell if im faded or youre just fucking nuts
Does he find God in the end? Or does it end badly?
The primary theme is dream-states and the stories all work on pushing the other major theme of how cataclysmic or pivotal events in people lives &#039;kill&#039; them and &#039;rebirth&#039; them as a new person.

Got a few ideas in my head of things I&#039;d want to write. Mainly fantasy and scifi settings.Just some basic ideas atm. Currently chiseling out the details on the fantasy one though.

obviously i want to bring it back to the girl but i don&#039;t want to do some cliche shit like him breaking down in front of her grave

Didn&#039;t watch that movie yet


HA. How naive do you think i am.
Perfect 5-10 page short story material, don&#039;t go too long though, keep it short and sweet
If you had the right voice this would be a great 45 page short story
as a short story yeah i can see this being alright
I&#039;d like to see how you handle the more active, character-based scenes, and if they&#039;re as good as your handling of setting in the extract you posted.
i like the concept, i love how you write but i completely hate the sound of that ending


Please guise somebody validate me
I feel ya man. Not good enough to rate well, and apparently to be rated either.
It feels like it&#039;s missing a third act. As it stands it reads like the whole purpose is to shill this diet.
Second one is gibberish. Nothing seems to relate to anything else. Make it 1000+ pages and /lit/ will have a meme tetralogy.

and it&#039;s not really a diet that can be shilled. MC eats lots of nutritious food to restore himself...

alright guys, this is my first idea so be gentle Not really sure where it&#039;s gonna go from there. I want to have some kind of satire on current activism and &#039;slacktivism&#039; type stuff.
no one would believe it, though. Try to write something more realistic.
I&#039;m writing something very similar to Le Horla.

A man is sentenced to death for plotting against the government, the moment before he is killed a USA government agent informs him that all people executed are told one state secret. The plot is contained inside an execution chamber, the agent has the potassium cyanide pill to initiate the execution and executes the prisoner at the end of the story, and all dialogue and descriptions are attributed to only the two characters.
MC is a young girl (18yo) who is pretty normal and well rounded but reads too many romance novels and has very few friends.Then I&#039;m not sure where to go with the story when they break up.

For the happy ending, I want her slowly recovering pieces of her former self but becoming someone more mature/honest and dating another guy who exemplifies these traits. I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s trash but I need some practice.

A man steals his (ex)wife&#039;s son and they run away to another country - evading the bull as though he was the Nubian God of the Hunt. The wife&#039;s son eventually becomes his son.
How about you take an unexpected twist with her realising, as she returns to her old self, how boring she is and that she was enjoying becoming &quot;a reflection&quot; or &quot;more of&quot; the man. That she liked the feeling of giving up herself. She wants to return to him, but he&#039;s still a cold asshole that doesn&#039;t like her and she wonders what she&#039;ll do. Perhaps she&#039;s torn and afraid of how others will look at her for not following boring, societal expectations (individualism, independent woman, etc)

Having read the other two I&#039;m inclined to agree with you.

the prose is actually good
A PhD in physics and philosophy seeks a way to destroy all of existence or to sterilize all life at least due to his negative utilitarian principles while doing humanitarian work abroad to ease the suffering of others and coming across all the horrors this world has to offer while engaging in philosophical discussions with smart but optimistic characters every now and then.Not something I&#039;m working on, just something I&#039;d like to read and Thomas Ligotti is too implicit to write something like this.

Goes a bit further and after its known that they&#039;re all infected, after a few have died, it goes into its more supernatural plot
The act of eating a painting gains him special popularity and so people give him more paintings to eat so that he can describe the sensation. Soon he has his own television, web, and radio show where he eats old and new works and the people listen to his description of the taste, feel, and smell of his new diet. This inspires others to consume sculptures, carvings, even film (or digital microprocessors) which becomes a global movement until all art is sent to these critics who destroy and process all art.
It&#039;s always good to hit your audience over the head with your message
I feel like you would have to be very knowledgeable and skilled to get that right.
If you write it you should avoid using the word consume at all costs.
It&#039;s not really meant to be taken super seriously. The main aristocratic British characters regard them highly, more so than the Irishman and the Indian, but are a bit wary regardless due to their nationalistic feelings. BUT what makes it racist is that their, the German couple, surname is Kraut which is, at times, called at casually as a means of underhanded racism (I&#039;ve had it up to here with your Krauts! (Speaking specifically about the two and their child)) I assume also that the derogatory word of Kraut came later but I think it still works.
bretty good anon. yo&#039;ve got a strong author&#039;s voice. reminds me a bit of patrick süskind.
that&#039;s the basic premise. I want to work in themes on existentialism and the role war plays. Not anti-war though.
woah, slow down there Eliot.
would their relationship start while she was still a student? I feel like that could be a decent hook for the first part of the story
why not write a story about the guys who meme&#039;d him into office? something like a non-realism play with the MC being a basement dwelling NEET who has issues socializing.

Alternatively, make him somewhat delusional and cunning and working alone initially. He could mislead the terrorists into thinking he is part of a larger group of revolutionaries. This deception gains him esteem with the group which he uses to become their leader. All along he is misleading them into amassing him a small fortune from the oil and the attention of an intelligence agency who has several informants within the group. In fact, all the group are informants or agents working for local law enforcement, national law enforcement, military intelligence, the oil transfer company, the oil refining company, and the local news station. All agencies and corporations spy on each other while in this group and serve to elevate the MC into a credible threat, which the agencies desire as they all benefit from a large enemy more than a small one. MC gains his fortune and manages to slip away with his gains as the different groups get bogged down when they each discover the true identity of all members.

Stop trying to make up for lack of skill or lack of purpose in your writing with the assumption that good books are made from a good concept or idea. You might simply be to young to understand any insights in your life or have anything meaningful to say. Whatever the case, you won&#039;t have anything to say until you have something to say, all you can do now is keep writing and practicing so that when you have something to say you can explain, articulate, and structure your writing well.

Adventures of Huckleberry Finn
Stream of consciousness of a man locked in a straitjacket locked in a room. Begins entertaining himself by describing his scenario, the surrounding scenario, making self-conscious remarks about how he&#039;s ultimately just thinking because he can&#039;t not, about how he&#039;s desperately extending his thoughts to pass the time, he eventually begins repeating his points in a rephrased manner, interrupts himself by noticing this, brings to our attention the complete nooks and crannnies of the room, describes a couple of stains on the walls and floor, wonders on his situation, repeats himself, and so on for about a hundred pages.Basically my diary desu and my thinking behavior desu but with a straijacket and locked in a room instead of just profoundly bored. Could just do it with a dude alone on a car ride, an endless nothing surrounding him, idk.

Sounds boring and like a waste of time for both writer and reader. The point of writing is that you have something to say. Put something in there that actually matters and then go from there.
It&#039;s funny, because all you said was a bunch of vague nothings.

With good prose I&#039;d read it.
It&#039;s gonna be hard as fuck to do though.

Yeah, there&#039;s simply too many stimulants in my life. And, comparatively, I still live like a hermit. I appreciate what I read more though.
I went through one dry spell after I graduated college. I had stopped reading for pleasure well before that, but had to keep reading for school. Once school was done with I had no impetus to read and so I spent almost 2 years without so much as picking up a book. Eventually I recovered and started reading for pleasure again.
Yes, whenever I have time off from work. I read exclusively on my commute.
I haven&#039;t read properly in 3 years
Since graduating almost two years ago, I&#039;ve been steadily reading, starting a new novel a day or two after finishing one. However I took breaks as a student, and once I find myself an actual job have to imagine I&#039;ll take breaks then.

Thats not actually exceptionally common on reddit. They more often cite meme sites and statistcs, its like centrist pol.
Took me a while but I found the cringe
is this from ready player one or waht?

I seriously thought I was reading a blogpost written by a teenager. Ready Player One can&#039;t be that bad, can it? Spielberg is making a movie about this shit?

This is quite remarkable, as I get the feeling this is a bad imitation of bad writing. There are several layers of badness here.

qt Olivia Cooke is in it, so there&#039;s one redeeming factor at least.
the thing about this is that from spielbergs perspective... a movie about this wouldn&#039;t be grotesque at all. it&#039;s the spectacle of a book worshipping lower media at the expense of literature that is truly disgusting about ready player one. a movie version of it is totally ... normal

fuckin doubt it. Women don&#039;t mind a guy who&#039;s funny, arrogant and knows it. They can smell a guy who just quietly thinks he&#039;s smarter than everyone because he doesn&#039;t have the balls to actually act like it from a mile away.
Because it&#039;s just smarmy self-satisfaction masquerading as modesty. You could argue that it&#039;s deliberately like that because a smarmy, self-satisfied character is talking but the way it&#039;s presented suggests otherwise.
&gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/

It&#039;s not well written at all
Ready Player One is not as bad as it could have been, but it&#039;s still really, really bad. The entire book feels like &quot;nerd culture&quot; masturbation, with only the most simplistic plot elements keeping together a sinking ship made of pop-culture references. It&#039;s horrible on nearly every possible level.

What is the Hypernormalisation of literature? Who are Adam Curtis&#039; literary influences?
Adam Curtis is a hack who throws together tangentially related bits of information he read on wikipedia and then reads them all off over archival footage.
Something to really look into is the deep role that organized crime played in what happened to the USA economy beginning with the &#039;60s and &#039;70s mergers and acquisitions booms and especially the &#039;80s leveraged buy-out boom... &quot;Supermob: How Sidney Korshak and His Criminal Associates Became America&#039;s Hidden Power Brokers&quot; would be a good place to start with that

Tor&#039;s Best Books of 2016 Edition
I think Steve is a really great guy and a good author
Here is the reviewers’ choice books
I dropped The Long Way off my reading list because somebody on another site mentioned there&#039;s a character who basically exists to be mean to everybody, and the ship&#039;s captain does nothing about this or the other crew don&#039;t just give him a blanket party (&quot;it&#039;s just a bad dream fatboy&quot;) for causing trouble, which really just breaks one&#039;s suspension of disbelief.
Good fantasy recommendation for my friend? He likes classics, the bronte sisters, anime, edge chronicles, and xenoblade chronicles.

Tor pushes out some pretty tumblr-tier shit. Not that they don&#039;t publish a lot of good books but I&#039;ll be fucked if I&#039;m going to trust their reviewers not to be agenda driven. I read for funsies, not to be beaten over the head with gender politics.

Why don&#039;t you add Bakker to that
That&#039;s pretty normal for the 10,000 word mark. You&#039;ll get more out of it if you can actually finish it instead of restarting a dozen times.
6/10 Final verdictBesides, it has airships and I struggle with airships because I instinctively lump them with the much loathed steampunk even when the book isn&#039;t actually steampunk.
Just finished this. I enjoyed it but why does everyone act like it&#039;s so confusing? You can figure out what almost everything is just by context in which it&#039;s referenced.
Warrens were a bit confusing at first but that&#039;s it.
Has anyone ever answered that question? I&#039;ve only ever seen it met by memes.
There&#039;s still a lot of stuff you have no clue about yet, but you have the right mindset for reading it which is to just take it as it comes and trust that things will be explained eventually. If you obsess too much over working out details in MBotF you&#039;ll never get very far because it takes several books before you have enough information to really piece the mythos together.
This. Tor isn&#039;t accepting novellas in their new contest or whatever that are based on European culture. Medieval/High fantasy is inherently white. If someone who isn&#039;t white wants to write about African wizards, then power to them, but banning Eurocentric fantasy is like hosting a white-only RnB festival
We literally answer Dying Earth and New Sun every single time. Feeling of loneliness and isolation in a vibrant, overgrown world where most of what&#039;s going on can&#039;t possibly be understood; New Sun additionally has a near-hopeless mission to reignite a fire source.

I went through my steampunk fetish phase, and I think the problem with the genre is that people completely forget that it&#039;s supposed to be retro science fiction. Instead of thinking of something new that asks questions, they regurgitate aesthetics that they will grow out of. The vast majority of Steampunk lacks originality
So the answer is that there really isn&#039;t anything like Dark Souls, then. Those thematic similarities aside, BotNS doesn&#039;t even have a slightly similar feel or aesthetic to it.
Isn&#039;t it just melanin-enriched Conan?
For fuck&#039;s sake I come from the generation that invented this shit and I am as tolerant as they come so why do I have to read books that are actively attempting to make me feel guilty about behaviours that I don&#039;t participate in.

Is that a problem?
Just sounds done desu.
Lots of works have broadly similar themes, but feel extremely different, therefore not necessarily appealing to a mutually inclusive audience. I can see why the memes took over.

I have never seen a girl named Madara in my life
dont be a fool
But the character archetypes are a lot more like you&#039;d find in, say, Gods Must Be Crazy 2 than Shannara. Grizzled mercs, ideological refugees, clueless city folk out for adventure.
Sanderson would probably think long and hard about that, then say it depends on exactly what you&#039;re slicking and how, and how if you do it wrong you might actually make it easier for it to cut you. He probably won&#039;t go down the route of careless edgedancers making their limbs slick off, but he might make it easier for swords to glance away.
Can someone point me in the direction of where I could get Roadside Picnic in Russian/cyrillic? I&#039;m trying to learn the language and I also want to read it in its original prose. I can&#039;t find it for download either, so I guess I&#039;ll have to buy it.

Is the sci-fi sjw aids spreading to fantasy now, these people need to be put in ovens.
Fantasy has been a vehicle for political correctness for a while now.
Not so much the mainstream and popular stuff from what I can tell. And no the lack of GRI doesn&#039;t count, I mean obvious agenda like this shit. One could argue for the kingkiller chronicle but I think that one hilariously fails at it by being a male power fantasy but for white knight orbiter nerds.
Authentic European medieval culture is just as unexplored and foreign as any other culture in the modern post-Tolkien fantasy genre. I find it just as offensive for it to be the subject of Jewish discrimination as such done on the basis of race. Especially since I doubt that they truly embrace other cultures and that they really just want western liberalism (which is corrupted Christianity) with a light Oriental flavour.
Maybe they just don&#039;t like the competition.
And if you go in-depth in individual European medieval cultures wouldn&#039;t that be more like historic fantasy not just inspired by whatever fantasy? I do think we could use more of that but you need actual knowledge of history to do that right so most people aren&#039;t going to find the effort.
They&#039;re different breeds. Both bears and wolves are predators, they both hunt and they both eat the lesser animals. Yet the wolf does not get along with the bear, can you imagine why? It&#039;s a silly question, so I assume that you are a rabbit or a deer.
I don&#039;t see /pol/ going over to other countries and raising hell while the media portray them as poor, helpless refugees that are being discriminated against.

Notice how the sjw will not even try to defend the point that started the whole discussion and just try to derail into shitposting, possibly by typing something stupid while pretending to be the opposition then jerking themselves off, or just picking out some random shitpost to reply to.

Holy shizt, keep em coming. You&#039;re making my day.

The people talking about it before they came along, I agree that you obviously can&#039;t discuss anything with them.
&quot;What would /pol/ do if they had the size and influence of Islam?&quot;
Whichever ones dont censor his blatant racism.
Stop the white genocide. Remove Jewish influence from society. Create monoethnic states. They wouldn&#039;t flood the east with welfare sucking parasites in the hopes of winning a long term demographic war.
The inverse of how things are now, which is trading shit for shit. The human race should be done away with all together in retrospect of that. Preach that one group is objectively inferior to another and then go about how life is carved by your own hands. Shitty species that thinks it&#039;s intelligent, only in comparison to the other retarded life on the planet. The equivalent to an average kid being in a special ed class and being proud of being the top student.

You should write to Sanderson and tell him you&#039;ve discovered something sharper than the Shardblades : your edge.
Theres no discussion to be had with the likes of you.
What do we have here in this thread?
I do not browse /pol/, too close to /b/ for my taste. But keep on lying, we all know it&#039;s what you do best.
But all of this is digressing. Is Edgedancer worth reading?
Human species.
I would also like to know how they manage to concile Christ&#039;s command to love your enemy, turn the other cheek and all that hubbub with their fixation on race wars and genocides. The two seem kind of incompatible to me, but then again they probably just use doublethink.
Not him, but the trouble with our fantasy books is that 99% of them are never translated to English.
Really gets the noggin joggin
Edgedancer, read it if you&#039;re a completionist and want to know all that is going on in the Stormlight saga, but be advised that Lift is the worst character Sanderson ever wrote and the novella is entirely about her. the Herald Of Justice is cool though.
Race war when?
come on, you&#039;re from /pol/
What&#039;s a good relatively short fantasy novel that&#039;s good for winter? I need to read three novels before the end of the year to reach my quota
The Left Hand Of Darkness is a book in which winter plays a pretty important role, and it&#039;s also really good, perhaps the best &quot;bromance&quot; story I&#039;ve ever read.
You seem to have the Jewish liberal version of Christianity confused with the real deal. Humanism and other such perversions are reprehensible.
Now. Yesterday and Tomorrow too. It has always been and will always be an ongoing struggle.
Are you 14 by some chance and pretending to be one to collect (you)s? Not that real ones are much smarter so it is hard to tell.
Ah, so you just recategorized and redefined Christ&#039;s meaning to fit your own narrative. Thanks for clearing that up.

Like everyone else who ever read it. The bible&#039;s meaning is based on how the person interprets it. You can rationalize any idea with it.
It&#039;s not even true that you don&#039;t like politics in your SFF. If that were true you would be against Vox Day just as much as you are against say, Ann Leckie. Because their works are equally agenda-driven. You just don&#039;t like politics in SFF -when don&#039;t agree with you-. Which is ironic in readers of a genre that is all about different perspectives. But I guess hypocrites will be hypocrites.
And I thought we could be friends. Just goes to show that you can&#039;t judge someone by how intelligent they sound when they type.
No, this is what the Jews and atheists have done. I have done no such thing.
That&#039;s a mighty far leap to begin with.
I&#039;ve also heard he mostly if not totally keeps his politics out of his books so this is probably another lie for the pile.
This is a reaction to the leftist domination of genre fiction, it&#039;s your politicking that gives him influence. Were there no authoritarian leftist clique then he would have next to no renown. As far as his books go I am unaware of any agenda being espoused because I have not read them. The only reason I know of him is because of whining queers like GRRM making a fuss over what they consider heresy to the leftist dogma.
Also you should know that in the last years of his life Lovecraft disavowed racism and conservativism and basically called himself a retard for ever having believed that shit.
This is fucking asinine.
 or indeed the results of the awards previous to the puppies. I don&#039;t actually read much of what Vox writes, the big names however seem united against any voices of dissent towards their ideology. As for Lovecraft I don&#039;t think he ever was a conservative, just opposed to nihilism.
So &quot;anyone?&quot; What is even the point of typing all this
That means anyone who isn&#039;t a straight white male
Anyone not white, male or straight is what they want. Because those people know how to write.
Guess I need to come up with a pen name that sounds foreign or something before I ever start trying to publish.
I can write to my heart&#039;s content, no one considers us white.
Do they consider Slavs to be white?
Basically, if you can&#039;t pass a diversity photo op you aren&#039;t wanted
Progressives probably do.
That&#039;s kind of disheartening. Should I just not even bother submitting to them? I can&#039;t pretend to be gay or whatever and re-write my story
As far as I can tell the &quot;no European&quot; thing is only one contest. It&#039;s not Tor&#039;s actual policy for ALL submissions, that would be fucking insane.
Can I tell them I identify as a transmediterranean?
They want it to be but then they wouldn&#039;t have anything to print. Realtalk: ff you don&#039;t wear your white guilt on your sleeve you can forget about Tor ever publishing your stuff if you&#039;re white.
Just start sucking cock and acting like a prancing lala homo man
But didnt Tor publish John C Wright? Doesn&#039;t Tor still publish Sanderson, whose books&#039; primary antagonists are literally black singing slaves?
Haven&#039;t you heard? Homos are on the list of &quot;enemies of progress&quot; now.
you what now
Sanderson is about as progressive/left-leaning as it gets for a Mormon.
I like the boats of the Glenn carrig, the house on the borderland, and the night land. The latter isn&#039;t for everyone though; a lot of people complain about the faux old timey writing style. It does have a really neat aesthetic though. &quot;The thing that watches from the north&quot; and the &quot;house of silence&quot; are cool and scary ideas.
so not at all.
Feminists have started hating gays.
If I loved Dune but wanted something like it that was purely fantasy which book should I pick up?
Been reading some Lynn Abbey and I have to say that I really like what she&#039;s done with Chronicles of Athas. Are any of her other stuff good too?
Prince of nothing
It&#039;s an attempt to capture child-like wonder with hidden subways and speakeasies that have continued to operate years after prohition ended, copious food porn and a low-key magic system based on particle physics
&amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;ie=UTF-8
So, should I still try to publish it after finishing it? I want the chance to start over and the whole project has changed so much since I started it seems like a cancerous mishmash of different stories
Gotta make sure that we have a seat at the table if this whole thing with being white does not work out


I don&#039;t get why people are so pissed about this contest thing. The entire point is that a near exclusive focus on european fantasy is leaving the genre stagnant and homogeneous.I guess /sffg/ wouldnt understand it since this general is all about shitposting over the same three authors over and over
Гoтчy, фaм.
And if you can find his politics in one of his works that is regularly discussed here I&#039;ll mail you a nickel.
I partially agree, however to understand the outrage you&#039;d have to be familiar with the context, ie the whole Hugo/Puppy thing. This is seen as part of a larger struggle.
Him and fedora man are mentioned every thread

God, is this going to be another gamegate scandal? Are people going to send Rowling rape threats and burn a cross on Jesmin&#039;s lawn? I had better start collecting rare Sandersons
No. The best fantasy is based on quality stories with identifiable characters. Besides, simply making a character trans, or the setting African will not improve a poorly written book. As such, by having arbitrary identity based stipulations on submissions Tor is putting identity politics before quality stories.
Wright, yes, by the same person. Day, only in awards season and when he&#039;s just released a book.
And you can trust authors to give you quality stories with identifiable characters when they&#039;re putting the work in on their worldbuilding too.
Is this sarcasm?
This has been happening for the last four years now. Both sides have engaged in shit flinging of the highest order, and that includes a flame war between John C Wright and GRRM. Have you been living under a rock?
People saying that &quot;progressive SFF&quot; is bad yet it seems like nobody here reads new booksReally fires up the neurons
Is Bakker a feminist?
What&#039;s that about?

No, ive been staying out of bullshit micropolitics and reading
don&#039;t know about that but he seems to be craving for cock
Wright gets a bunch of his works on the Hugo ballots because VD asks his blog readers to register and vote. Scalzi and Gurm and co. get the vapors, GRRM writes a blog post about how this is such a travesty, ALL those Puppy picks are horrible people and horrible writers, Wright shows up in the comments saying, hey, you didn&#039;t think I was a horrible writer when you bought my Dying Earth story for the Jack Vance tribute anthology. GRRM goes yeah, you did great on that, captured Vance&#039;s voice better than anyone I know, but you&#039;re still a terrible person for being involved with VD, and also your stories this year aren&#039;t as good. And it goes back and forth with Wright wanting a retraction on him being a horrible writer and GRRM trying to move the goalposts to the current awards, and I don&#039;t think anyone involved even read the stories.
C&#039;mon, man, this is the biggest SFF drama since the Vietnam editorial thing.
Good Lord he has absolutely no idea what he is taking about. Cult tier thinking.
Could you even name three post-Tolkien authors who produced authentic tales in the European tradition? I&#039;m not talking about liberal fantasies about how bad it was before the enlightenment but the real thing. Are there even any traditionalist fantasy authors alive today? Culturally the genre is not European but American and America doesn&#039;t have a real culture.
I assume so. The sole focus on world building is one of the main reason fantasy is so shit these days. They literally just add shit without thinking of the thematic purpose.

Do you even read fantasy?
Why does /pol/ ruin everything?

Kek
That&#039;s not good world-building though. Seek only good worldbuilding and you will not have it, just as when you write a fantasy novel and seek only character, and let the world fall to the wayside, you have only produced a normiebook with pointy-eared people and wagons.
these fucks literally just go to various threads to REEEEEEEE against modernity they have no hobbies besides promoting their epic fashy ideology
No, I also come to these threads to &quot;ree&quot; against modernity and I also promote authoritarian ideologies, I&#039;m just concerned this man has only surface-level understanding of his own heritage. I apologize for the confusion.
Those who live in places other than basements dont go &quot;Reeeeeeeee.&quot; That&#039;s a screech reserved for tea kettles and vampires. You find yourself in suitable company among blood suckers and hot air
Get hyped lads.-new-red-rising-trilogy
But that&#039;s why I loved the first trilogy so much.
tfw love space opera but dislike hard scifi
sffg, how do you adapt speech patterns to different time periods to make them seem believable but still readable?One of my characters has a ranting, sesquipedalian sort of speech pattern that seems too modern to fit the prohibition-era atmosphere. I want too keep the attitude without obvious anachronism
My interest in Red Rising fell off hard in the third book when it was more about the world, I was bored by the viking planet even though it was a cool sequence
Godsdoom seems cool, thanks for the reccomendation
Is esmenet the most realist depiction of women in modern fantasy?
Jesus Christ that last line in The Death Of Dr.Island chilled me to the bone. Wolfe, you beautiful bastard.
Asking again since it was late at night when I last asked.
Try The Dragons Of Babel. Same setting as Iron Dragon&#039;s Daughter, but better written.
Middle is classiest. Old cheesy fantasy covers a best.
People so often mistake world building with setting building. Setting is the environment in which characters interact and undergo conflict. The setting should reflect the underlying themes of the story and reinforce what is at stake in the conflict. You are just retarded if you think worldbuilding is what makes a good story.
Thanks.
Anyone read all of Elizabeth Moon&#039;s stuff?I loved Deed of Paks and Vatta&#039;s War is also really fun, I&#039;m wondering if that quality holds up with her other stuff
Is the Black Company any good?
White guilt is ruining the west.
Yes
Jury&#039;s still out on Bakker and Erikson.
The other three are obviously bad
The Republic of Thieves was much better than Red Seas Under Red Skies, but yeah, a definite stumble after his first book.
Buy used or pirate.
nah. Serwe is though

Are there any fantasy novels that use a setting similar to pic related? Not talking about Urban Fantasy stories that still use the real world. I mean, instead of ripping off Tolkien, rip off PRESENT DAY, PRESENT TIME Earth? Final Fantasy games are the only things I can think of right now that have worlds like this.

From Jack Vance, should I get Demon Princes or Dying Earth? Isn&#039;t the former like classic adventure sci-fi and the latter post apocalyptic?
I&#039;d say get the former because I found Dying Earth really boring.
Thank you for your opinion anon, I was leaning towards it too due to opinion from friends, apparently it just keeps getting better until book 4 but I wanted a /sffg/ opinion on them
No one wants Post-industrial fantasy because post-industrial society because swords &gt; magically augmented ARs
It&#039;s a good but unambitious (well it&#039;s YA so that&#039;s not too surprising) fantasy story. Has a sort of pseudo-slavic setting which is a bit different from usual, and a sort of Stalker style &quot;Zone&quot; being central to the plot.
Does romance and fantasy ever work well? I&#039;ve had meager dealings with it and it always ends up being shoehorned in for convenience or a total afterthought.

What is the best English translation of Sappho?
i love that painting of sappho smoking a joint. the best translation is the one by anne carson.
That&#039;s what I thought, thanks anon
I&#039;ve never read Carson&#039;s translations, but I really like David West&#039;s.
all of sappho is like ten pages; read and compare different ones to see what you like
I want to fffuck Sappho!
i dont know
i dont know
What would fucking Sappho be like?
What is your favorite book in the Bible? I started reading it last week and I&#039;m looking for some direction. So far, I&#039;ve read Psalms, Ecclesiastes, Proverbs, Genesis, Exodus, and Leviticus. Should I just read from cover to cover at this point? I noticed there are 3 more books of Moses.
Judges is one of my favorites. It&#039;s very proto-Western, since it covers a fairly lawless period between Moses/Joshua being the leaders and the first Kings of Israel.
GenesisDon&#039;t let autists tell you genesis is shit, it&#039;s like saying any work of literary fiction is garbage because it didn&#039;t actually happen

I like the one where everyone fucking dies &gt;:-)
not happen and be truer than the truth.
Ah yes, Sampson. Kind of strange to put that in there but I guess the jews needed a herculean figure.
Reading Genesis in the context of &quot;is it true? is it not true?&quot; is a weird Christian habit that was almost never done in the distant past.
Be sure to read pic related when you get to the NT
I will never read it due to your constant shilling. What compels you to post it in every single thread related to the bible? Are you the author or is it just autism?
The holy spirit
No need to read cover-to-cover, which can get tedious (although you&#039;ve already read Leviticus, maybe the most so). I recommend reading from the OT and NT concurrently
I don&#039;t think I&#039;m ever going to get used to sharing discussions with smug redditors
Book of Job desu.
There are no answers to suffering, only mysteries.
J O BB
I like Isaiah quite a lot.Luke is my favourite gospel almost purely because of the dialogue between Christ and the two criminals. John is pretty swell too.
The great thing about genesis though is that it&#039;s a relatively decent introduction to the abrahamic religions.
hey what&#039;s your reading speed? you can google reading speed tests,i used this one http://www.readingsoft.com/

im 18 btw and ive read just about 25 books in my life
I read a lot daily, because you know, basic human activity, lotsa signs on the road and such.
 signs and 4chans dont count
266Not bad actually. But I would love to improve it
500, give or take
318.Nice, but it can still improve.
Nobody needs to tell you to fuck off, you&#039;ll just get banned. Unless the mods don&#039;t care.
I think it´s pretty good.
263. It&#039;s way down from high school where I could max out at 100 pages per hour in a standard paperback novel.
Little online test says 206 with 91% comprehension.Slow and steady wins the race.
389Something tells me their claim that reading on a screen is 20% slower than reading on paper is totally unsubstantiated, though
220The sample text wasn&#039;t the best in terms of comprehension. People process numbers/statistics differently to say a piece of fictional prose.
Not too happy with that
I read at the level of a 12 year old before I started school.
253 completely sub-vocalized.notarace.tiff
185. Mind you, I read to comprehend. I don&#039;t skim or skip any words for fear of losing the texts actual meaning. I also have a voice in my head when i read, but for /lit/ I know this is plebeian. But for the life of me I can&#039;t get rid of it. Any way, I never had trouble in university and I read a lot of books, 4-5, per course every semester.
Of course this varies, to the extent where I only end up reading about 400 pages per 5-7 days
349 at 100% comprehension.I specifically avoided speed reading faster because of the instructions.
239 wpm, 79% retention, according to one of the tests posted ITT. Sounds about right for reading something I don&#039;t particularly care about.
256. I&#039;m surprised since I thought I was an incredibly slow reader. It&#039;s probably because I&#039;m just distracted most of the time, but when I take a test like this I focus.
275English ain&#039;t my native language, I be sleepy and shit
339. I don&#039;t think that accurately reflects the speed I read a novel. I&#039;ve always been a fast reader but I&#039;ve never done speed reading.

600 at 82% comprehensionThis year my uni course required a lot of reading as well as deep knowledge and discussion of what we have read so that has helped me no end with that.

802 with 70% comprehensionIf I want 80% comprehension I need to drop to about 200.
300 at 100% comprehension
dont care enough to finish the test, i figure im 300 or slower, but i have to imagine im &gt;90% comprehension. Maybe i&#039;m &quot;autistic&quot; but when i read (i only read stuff that&#039;s worth my time) i think i take my time more than most people
i dont know
This is probably why I love Don DeLillo. His sentences are exquisitely chiseled
On my phone which screen is broken screen. I&#039;m not a native english speaker.
i feel like it doesn&#039;t get as much as appreciation as it should b/c it was force-fed to us in school
Fuck off with your reddit-tier literature
you&#039;re pathetic
My favorite book. It will stick with you forever.
right? i love it because it has steinbok&#039;s amazing description and style but it isn&#039;t as naturalistic as his other books...man actually has a shot creating his own destiny...
Lee and Cathy are the best characters.
i went through all of school without having to read any steinbeck, can you believe that? but i did end up reading him on my own. I&#039;ve only read grapes of wrath, cannery row, and travels with charley.someday i will read east of eden. im sure it is very good.
east of eden is a lot different ~message~ wise!!! i hope you get a chance soon!
I like Abra a lot as well. Cathy and Lee are definitely the most interesting. Completely opposite in morality haha
the last third was shit
*sucks own dick*
Cathy is one of the least interesting characters in all of western canon. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;m a huge Steinbeck fan , but he shit the bed making such an arbitrarily evil character.
I thought it was a very good book. Quite similar to Jean Paul Sartre in its philosophy.

Cathy was a very well done psychopath but I think she&#039;s overrated when people claim she&#039;s one of the great villain in fiction. She&#039;s just alright. Though I find it interesting that Steinbeck makes it almost a point that psychopaths are the ones who are the most free to fuck with people because they lack empathy.
The strong only respect the strong, and Cathy never had someone who took her by the throat.
I liked East of Eden but Grapes of Wrath was much better.

Can someone tell me what it&#039;s actually about? All the descriptions online suck dick.
did you read this in school? I was under the impression that most US schools that taught Steinbeck used Mice and Men or Grapes.
Not OP, we were assigned Of Mice and Men but we got to choose a great American novel to write a term paper on and many are encouraged to read East of Eden.
yeah! It was summer reading and then we discussed it at the start of the year. we did of mice and men as well a different year but no grapes of wrath
follows the lives of a couple families in the town of salinas (where steinbeck actually grew up!) for generations. i think its loosely based off his own family
John Steinbeck is in the book. His mother is one of the Hamiltons. He even describes being fond of Tom. Not sure it really happened.
Bump
how&#039;s taste
As I got further and further on, Steinbeck pushed humanism more and more. &quot;Triumph of the Human Spirit&quot; type stuff seems awfully phony, especially the part where Kate is distraught after Cal confronts her and tells her that she is scared (or something like that). Books like this tell you just as much about life as Candide; sure they&#039;re cheery, but there is almost a saccharine sweetness to them.
i dont know
Is it worth reading The Lord of the Rings if I have seen the films a million times?
Theres a lot of weird shit that got cut, like they all get roofied by an insane forest pixie that never appears again, and a really long epilogue where saruman is still alive and they need to stop him
Is it worth reading Harry Potter if i have seen the films a million times?
i dont know
Thanks pal
Alright /lit/, how would you write a locked-room murder?
He entered by the WINDOWAnd took his life, and so the widow&#039;s HOPE.
Murder mysteries are the least talked about of genres OTB
An spooky ghost did it
the police assume that it&#039;s suicide and then it turns out that it is
THE DETECTIVE DID IT
just copy my diary desu
it would be ground breaking
though this has probably been done too

this one&#039;s pretty spicy
Anyone else /prodigy/?
this one&#039;s fucking great
Killer also had the key
But will he ever pay for his crime.
they did that in a scooby doo episode

Sounds like the plot to one of those islamic state short movies.
A witch did it.
So the victim got squashed too? How do they manage to blame it on each other?
t. Stephen King
It would require some fine tuning, but the awesome thing about it is that all you have to do is put one person outside the room, and they&#039;re the murderer, yet that answer isn&#039;t too obvious, so the clever reader still has to dig and find the answer for themselves.
lmao
Ladders aren&#039;t cheap
The house would rather murder everyone in the family and staff and forever be shunned as a haunted house than turn into something it was not meant to be. Home to the deathbeds of more than a dozen lords, it could not accept a commoner.
I know it&#039;s a kind a guilty pleasure for some, but what are the best/the most well respected murder mysteries and locked room murders? I haven&#039;t ever read any.

anon if you do not write or make anything out of this i WILL steal it

how the fuck can a balloon fly out of a closed room?
Has this been done?

I would rewrite Stephen Crane&#039;s &quot;The Blue Hotel&quot; but make it novel length and take place in a single room
The balloon kicked down the door after murdering the man, obviously.
all questions on my mind, I must ponder them further...
They would find gunpowder in his hand.

There&#039;s a bunch of stuff in Africa, although many are like between whodunnits and procedurals.
Scifi crime story idea: a police state run around the concept of locking people up without trial in some kind of stasis because they&#039;re &quot;evidence&quot;
It always makes me smile how ATTWN&#039;s original title was Ten Little Niggers
how can anyone have such bad taste?
holy
chimney you daft cunt
There&#039;s a Columbo with something very similar.


Turns out he actually slipped and broke his neck
After several chapters of fruitful investigation, The suspects and detective are suddenly evacuated by police as that entire side of town goes up in an arsonist&#039;s blaze.It turns out he was killed by the arsonist, who joins the party and begins investigating the original murder after becoming enthralled by the detective&#039;s detailed case notes
That&#039;s quite cool. Reminds me of Memories of a Murder a bit.
Turns out the guy died from an accident but one of the suspects admitted he killed him, pleads guilty and gets executed.
It turns out the reader killed him by opening the book, turning the pages, and giving imaginative life to the story
Everyone assumes the the character named Victor Murdersly did it, but in fact, it was the reader who killed the victim
turns out that the victim was culture and the killer was global capitalism
Far out man.
you&#039;re on the right track
They have a hyper=aggressive matriarchy so they assume feminism, since they cannot believe that a man could do anything at all ever.
Too 90ies
Back in the game
monty python did it
He stole it!
The mystery becomes increasingly outlandish and seemingly unsolvable throughout the story as more and more elements are introduced, convoluting the plot to absurd extremes. In the end it turns out it never actually happened and the whole thing was the fabrication of a schizophrenic autist in a mental institution.
Read Beckett&#039;s Trilogy.
i dont know
First you need to know what the locked room is. So choose one!
What are his other books like? I found a copy of The Pale King in my local library, and I wanted to know if it&#039;s worth my time.
His nonfiction is extremely approachable and very funny. I highly recommend A Supposedly Fun Thing I&#039;ll Never Do Again, both the essay and the entire collection. The former is available online for free!
cut yourself
i dont know
His nonfiction is very much worth your time but the short stories are great, too.

I guess it&#039;s easy and effective to use words that already carry resonance, but it seems like such a masturbatory thing to do, like the author is trying to show off how well read they are or implying their book is the equal of whatever great work they&#039;re quoting.

The Sound and the Fury is an amazing title, easily top 5 Shakespeare lines

Tell me this, is it it The Sun ALSO Rises or The Sun Also RISES?
Gee I wonder who could be behind this post
I too want to know this
Not fiction, but Hell in a Very Small Place is a great title.
how can somebody not know what that&#039;s depicting
I scan it as, the SUN also RIses

Hrs quoting the Bible, it&#039;s not that masturbatory, most people at least have a passing familiarity with the bible
(it&#039;s the binding of isaac, you modernist)

How Green Was My ValleyI know some are memes, but those are great titles.
What I mean is, is it like 1) my dick rises, so does the sun, or 2) the sun sets, it also rises?
Emphasis on also. It isn&#039;t rare to remark on the sun rising, it is rare for that to be a secondary element

Wasp Factory is such a good fucking title
tither they return again.
No, that proves it&#039;s The Sun Also RISES. The Sun ALSO Rises implies there&#039;s something else that rises.

Are you young or just confused?
I instantly knew when I saw the cover.
My Twisted World
Birth of Tragedy is nice one too
Yeah, but you&#039;re the kind of unbearable cunt the brings up the fact that they studied late Renaissance art to strangers on the internet so...
good for you
The sun rises and falls like generations come and go; by saying also, there&#039;s an implied comparison between the two.
I&#039;ve only studied early Renaissance art and I still knew what it was.
Cmon man that&#039;s fuckin isaac

But that title is incorrect. It should have be named &quot;Birth of Melodrama&quot;.

Good book too

Not the same guy, but I didn&#039;t know what the painting in OPs pic was in reference to. I know the story, but never saw the painting and am not interested in paintings in general so there&#039;s no reason for me to see it.

Free will doesn&#039;t exist
I choose to believe it does :^)
and what are the implications of your findings
He can&#039;t be held accountable for being a dumb frogposter
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I can&#039;t help but believe in it
prove that it does
depends how small you wanna getI think it&#039;s a bit of both. Free will exists like little balls bouncing around inside a circle with set parameters. they can bounce around inside these circles which ever what way but can&#039;t bounce out
it ultimately depends on whether or not one submits to a Bayesian understanding of probability or notdo not kill yourself (for that reason)
Free will exists.

Not really. Citation?
fucking compatibilists don&#039;t under stand that concepts are human-relative; we don&#039;t even know what it would mean to have free will if free will requires total ontological independence from things like causation
Acknowledging that changes nothing.
Why would it though?
it doesn&#039;t! it couldn&#039;t!
Conspiracy theorist&#039;s call them rods, sometimes they are 20 feet long. I hope they aren&#039;t malignant.
Are you implying compatibilists claim it does? They don&#039;t...
Compatibilism is just determinism.
do you mean incompatibilists?
yeah man i see it
no.
So one may as well live as if free will does exist.
Only through God
if free will doesn&#039;t exist then you don&#039;t have the free will necessary to make the conclusion that free will doesn&#039;t exist. Your argument has already invalidated itself. Next
nice bait
If free will doesn&#039;t exist, why do we need religion or governance?
I&#039;ll stick with Occam&#039;s Razor, thanks.
my post was in support of compatibilism; compatibilists say that free will doesn&#039;t require ontological independence--I&#039;m saying that, further, we don&#039;t even know what ontologically independent free will would look like
Fucking hate these threads. Sage.
wow rekt
But the balls dont controll any of the factors which determine their trajectory. Just like humans are unable to choose their enviroment and biology, which will define their ability to select the options they&#039;re presented with.
What would an &quot;existing free will&quot; actually look like to begin with?
No, its a branch of determinism
Hi, 18th century.
It literally requires you to disbelieve the causal relationships you observe everyday to be true. You&#039;ve no doubt as to what happens you flip a light switch, there&#039;s nothing to suggest you&#039;re brain is somehow fundamentally different.
&quot;Determinism is compatible with free will&quot; doesn&#039;t entail or imply that determinism is true
It&#039;s not just that it doesn&#039;t exist- and one could easily define &quot;free will&quot; to refer to something that does- but that the concept that is groped at with it is meaningless, worthless, and non-existent.
he can, because he did those actions, even if they weren&#039;t freely chosen, they are a symptom of his character
do you punish people for exhibiting symptoms?
yes it does you untermenchzlichztz
Yes we do, and we have for thousands of years, and our notion of justice has been founded on the idea that some symptoms are worthy of punishment and others are not.
This is how thin the concept is; no ontological independence is required. All we mean when we say &quot;he acted out of his own free will&quot; is that, had he chosen to do otherwise, he would have done otherwise--that he could not have chosen to do otherwise is neither here nor there.
Why should I care about whether free will exists or not?
instead of quibbling over whether or not it exists—an irrelevant metaphysical debate—we should understand that the existence of the contradiction within metaphysics is itself symptomatic.
&quot;What could have been&quot; is just a hypothetical about our knowledge, viz. &quot;at some time we did not know what in fact was&quot;. None of these alternative realities contemplated is the true one.
God and free will are mutually exclusive

Idiot.
hidden variable theory is a meme
It&#039;s more like a dog on a leash tethered to a cart
&quot;Free will&quot; doesn&#039;t mean there is no such thing as influence or cause and effect. It means that within reasonable parameters and abilities, people make conscious decisions. Our brains are, to point out the fucking obvious, a bit more complex than light switches. And even with light switches, you do NOT know what&#039;s going to happen when you flick the switch: you&#039;re just betting on the odds. Or have you never flipped a switch and watched a bulb pop, or had nothing happen?
Or had nothing happen and begin to levitate, as you realize you&#039;re dreaming?
this is a merely verbal dispute
Free from precisely what?
The brain is like an enormous network of switches, still working on the binary framework of ON/OFF. Neurons either activate or not, it&#039;s just that there are billions of them.
What exactly do you suggest that &quot;will&quot; is free from?
Citation needed
Key term there is &quot;all-or-nothing.&quot;
A current theory in computational neuroscience is that consciousness doesnt even really exist and its sort of just a momentary picture of all the signals currently in transitAll that needs to happen for an organism to function is that the neuron transfer functions work, there is literally nothing happening at all in someones brain other than neurons putting together signals and producing more, of course you dont have conscious control over that procedure because that procedure makes your &#039;consciousness&#039; in the first place

All we perceive are ideas, and these are immediately and directly perceived. There is no such thing as light -- as in a physical entity.
So you fell for the Cartesian duality meme, huh?
And what activates them?
Hello m&#039;lady... still believing in Free Will? ----
From total influence from an outside force.
Shit is random. Scientists only try to give useful theories, they&#039;ll never get to the bottom of anything.
Reminder that the universe is essentially random, non-rational, unscientific. The idea that we can understand the word through rational methods is a Platonic meme that won&#039;t die.
You&#039;re determined to believe it exists though so there is a paradox of believing it exists for various reasons even though the determination to believe contradicts the notion of free will.
Reminder that you - the person reading this - possesses a soul, an immaterial nucleus to your own consciousness that renders you immune to the trappings of material determinism.
Electric impulses from sensory receptors, and they activate each other - all in a dynamic interplay of forces, same as everything else.
Outside can&#039;t exist without inside, and vice versa. Neither is &quot;free&quot; from the other.

I bet none of you are plebbier than me
Yep, you&#039;re right, you&#039;re the biggest pleb here.
I&#039;m glad to see someone seek understanding
It&#039;s okay if you&#039;re reading a 700 plus page pomo meme and some references went over your head. Anything else, though, and you&#039;re max pleb.


If I want to read a book I check to see if it has a sparknotes page. If it does I don&#039;t read it. If it doesn&#039;t I don&#039;t read it but I tell people I did.
Genius.

holy...I want more
ITT: We try to trigger /lit/
I wholeheartedly enjoy genre fiction and appreciate its artistic merit as literature
I&#039;m /lit/ and its impossible to trigger me, I&#039;m so far along the dialectic offense is beyond my experience when I&#039;ve reconciled every contradiction
Achebe, Ngugi, Liyong, Armah, Adichie, Soyinka, Farah; let&#039;s just face it. The greatest English prose artists of the 20th century&#039;s latter half were Africans
Your genitals are substandard.

I am glad to have an opportunity to read the works of some writers who are not dead white men. Contemporary fiction has a lot to offer.
I&#039;m black so, need I say more
Well you&#039;re black so I doubt you have the vocabulary to say more.
/lit/ has no standards
My grandfathers language has a total of around 500 words and its capable of expressing more than any white man can dream of
that&#039;s a neat pic
Not the guy you&#039;re responding to but that&#039;s pretty interesting. What language is it if I may ask?
I&#039;m on mobile &amp; zooming in &amp; really putting my face next to the screen allows me to see them all

Looks like you did get triggered after all

Does /lit/ even admire or enjoy any of his writings? If so, why?
No. He&#039;s a hack and Reddit-tier. He was the original Stephen King
How is he a hack?
I love the majority of his writing. Even if he himself despised it. Hell a lot of his writings were never supposed to see the light of day and or were edited to death.
I am a fan.
His literature was too non-euclidian for the plebs
I&#039;m about halfway through The Lovecraft Compendium, never read any of his stuff before. My impression is that he writes really well and the worlds he creates are large and looming. But he emphasizes the fear of characters so much to make you feel it.
His monsters were more alien, perhaps more than any other author since. The attempts to break from anything within the realm of human experience, to put descriptions to things fundamentally indescribable due to their very alien remoteness from human experience, has yet to truly be matched. For whatever else there is to say, his originality set a standard for the outre.
his influence is insane
This. The creatures in At The Mountains of Madness were described well but were so strange that I couldn&#039;t get a clear picture of them in my head.
ayyyy lmao
Im not the biggest fan of his prose. Reading lovecraft is like reading a newspaper. His work is interesting due to the concepts it explores (eg cosmic horror/pessimism) alongside his influence on other texts.
i almost feel as if that was intentional. The reader creates the most horrifying image in their mind. one of the reasons why his lack of description &quot;indescribable&quot; Same thing with when the mob made people vanish. Those who hear about it generally start making creating a mental Horror that is the worst they can imagine. Guy was deranged...
I should have finished my question do you feel it was intentional?
Not a mind reader nor a necromancer, but I suspect that it was intentional. Many of his contemporaries described slavering beasts and horrific visions, but his monsters were well and truly alien, and to convey such would require the reader to not be able to truly form a clear image of the monsters. His word choice was often evocative, specifically choosing words which, while having visceral or emotional elements and reactions, did not have clearly defined images assosciated with them. Squamous and rugose.
Edgelord pls go
What did you kids use for insults before Reddit was around? Or is 2004 before you were born?
p.s. cannot read Lovecraft without imagining his stories as an escape horror game.
Cry harder, pussies
I like the spooky, tho.
What did you think of this book /lit/? I quite liked it, Max Brooks is really good at world building.
Really fun desu, 3 years later I still remember many of the chapters.
It&#039;s a solid piece of entertainment.

Isn&#039;t that movie basically basically in &quot;development hell&quot;, while Spielberg actually works on this?
Shit, they&#039;re really making a movie? Those weren&#039;t just threats?
Really liked it.
Yup. Complete with TJ Miller, Simon Pegg, and Tye Sheridan!
They just arrived; never read them.I know they are probably a meme, but I don&#039;t care.
bin them
Nah
Beautiful literature, potentially lost on some people. Not because they are high brow or anything (though the style and length are certainly offputting to some) but because the themes probably don&#039;t seem relevant in important ways to some people.
After trying to read through the series as an adult I loved the Tom Bombadil section but just gave up on the trite world building trivea during the gathering around the ring section
they are not a meme. you have no idea what a meme is.
I watched a documentary on Tolkien a week ago. He seemed like a very interesting person; having fought in France during WWII. Even though I haven&#039;t read them yet, I am familiar with the themes, and I do believe I will appreciate them.
To be honest, that&#039;s probably not a bad thing.
Looks nice. Have fun, and don&#039;t expect brevity. This isn&#039;t a modern fantasy: it uses language and moves the plot at an older pace.
Reading simsarillion atm
How is it?
Maybe you should watch that documentary again.
i&#039;m reading it and it certainly feels &quot;dense&quot;, specially because the version i have here has tiny fonts

Hey lit,Just finished reading A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. I understand the obvious themes like religion and restrictions and stuff, but I feel as if there is some deeper message which I&#039;m not getting. Anyone care to enlighten me?
No thats pretty much it, good job Anon you fully understood it
well maybe you&#039;re missing it too Anon
I haven&#039;t read Portrait, it&#039;s still on my to-read list, but I&#039;ve had similar feelings with other books. Usually looking for analysis and articles on the web about this book helps.
The book is a damn impressive experiment in the &#039;nicely polished looking glass&#039; of naturalist style. Its real achievements lie with its composition and the way Joyce builds his style according to the stages of aesthetic, emotional and intellectual development in Stephen&#039;s life - overcoming religion and limitation is all part of the making of the artist. It&#039;s autobiographical elements add another layer of depth to the text if you&#039;re interested in that sort of stuff too.
Overcoming is all part of making the man.
I found Stephen very relatable and saw a lot of myself in him. I saw the moral of the story as a call to life, the sensual world knocking on his door and pulling him out of his shackles of fear, inadequacy, conformity etc. and just being able to appreciate the world and all the lovely things in it without being so scared or meek.
dude. who gives a fuck. pick up the next book. come back to it later if it actually bothers you. it doesn&#039;t matter what joyce intended.

is that a fucking abridged moby dick
why would norton critical be abridged
It&#039;s so thin, though. I find it hard to believe that the full text is on so few pages--it looks like 300.
They might use that flimsy Bible paper

How are you liking Stoner so far?

Went to find a replacment for my copy of babbit i spilled soda on, walked out with this.How did i do?
Montaigne is based
four great picks
he&#039;s loving it, it&#039;s fantastic.
that was just a receipt from the purchase. I haven&#039;t started it. don&#039;t plan on reading it any time soon negro. but u heard it&#039;s a joyous read.
I like Waugh and Ford (pls pet marmalade kitty :3)
you&#039;ve got one book there you&#039;ll still want to read when you grow up. Possibly 1.5, depending on what made it into the irish stories collection.
Literally the first three books I&#039;ve ever bought. I know On The Road isn&#039;t his strongest but it was in sale. Also Salinger was one I missed in 9th grade and it&#039;s a book as an American you must read so I hear. It was on sale too.
go easy on me
so pleb. do better next time.
The picture is kind of crap so, from the bottom:The Chymical Wedding
Hey, I have that edition of The Odyssey.
How is naked lunch?
Cost me $9NZD. i was stoked
I think I paid about 20AUD. Lucky.
I also have a similar one for The Iliad.
Managed to get a copy of the Jin Ping Mei,the autobiography of the last chinese emperor and a small collection of Pu Songling&#039;s mystery/ghost storiesWhy not just keep alive one thread?
Recently bought:The City of God
Pleb spotted.
Good luck with Ulysses though
Not OP but that version is not abridged. Believe it or not the full text of Moby-Dick is about half of that paperback. The second half is supplemental material, critical essays, etc. It&#039;s about 400 of the 800 or so (very thin) pgs. Actually not unpleasant to read from though. Has great footnotes as well. Would recc.
So many britbongs on this board. No wonder /lit/s taste in philosophy is so shit.

Have you read anything else by Ford?
Why aren&#039;t you reading Montaigne in French if you know it?
Cormac McCarthy - The RoadFyodor Dostoyevsky - The Gambler

these are the books of a non pleb reader.
Sounds about right.
Really pumped about all of these. i have way too many unread books, but it feels so good to find books that i Know will be my favorites
I have finally finished my Gass collection. I now have all the Gass a man possibly could. 6 months of collecting Gass.
nigga never read a book Inn his life
ive read like 34 plus other not great ones from before i was /book/ that i dont count
but yes 34 is basically 0
lol
Bah, stop being a dick. 34 May seem like 0 to find elitist prick like you but on average that&#039;s a lot more than most people read their entire adult lives.
I learned later that the Alchimie etc was actually translated from english and I feel silly now because while I know french as a nearly native speaker i don&#039;t know alchemy terms even in english so i keep having to look up the definitions in one or both languages.
Went to a nearby book warehouse for the first time in a while. $45 for the stack, except for the Zweig and Tuchman, which my friend bought for me.Nice, and I feel your pain about 4chan fucking up image rotation without warning. Can you read ancient greek? If so, why those specific plays? If not, why not just get a complete set of Euripides?
I can - classics is what I studied mainly. And those plays because I like the loeb editions since I&#039;m lazy and you can just glance from the english to the facing greek whenever you&#039;re curious about a translation but not have to do all the thinking yourself.
i was just preparing for the ensuing patrician onslaught
not him but god its really good.
Where&#039;d you get that copy of Stein? All I ever see online is the newer edition.
Check abebooks and click &quot;seller-supplied images&quot; in the filters to see exactly what you&#039;re buying.
Absolutely plebeian.
That same edition&#039;s been sitting on a shelf in the back of one of my favourite bookstores for months now but I haven&#039;t had the heart to pull the trigger on it since most of what I&#039;ve read of Stein has left me cold. The first few paragraphs of TMoM seem pretty good, but I don&#039;t know if I could stand it over that length.
Although I totally understand having those books that you consider buying every week without wanting them quite enough to actually go for them.
He met Joyce, too
End you&#039;re live
Very cool, that&#039;s kind of what my friend was saying. Definitely sounds worth a shot.
Why do the big black penguin classics always look like that after one or two reads?
It&#039;s because the cover and spine are much stiffer than most paperbacks. It is totally possible to read them without breaking the spine, mine all look brand new after several readings, but it requires you to hold them somewhat uncomfortably and most people probably just can&#039;t be bothered.

Good pick up anon.

To what degree did he falsify his accounts, and why?
animals can&#039;t talk
The year 1984 didn&#039;t happen the way he claimed it would.
this
wrong
He wrote fiction
No British officer ever shot an elephant.
Who cares? He wrote literally the greatest book of all time. Hands down.
This all makes we wary of his accounts described in Homage to Catalonia. Just how much can you trust to be an accurate recount of the events, even if written in good faith?

i took an orwell class with one of the worlds top orwell scholars. he was literally a propaganda writer - this is evident in homage. burmese days and down and out in london are just typical embellishment - both are awesome.
Considering whether to dip for a $30 old model, ~$100 for PW/Glo HD, or all in for this Kobo Aura One for a first ereader.Thoughts?
I don&#039;t care.
There is no reason to get premium ereaders, im convinced they exist only to cater to that tiny sub-section of high income earners that want to have the most expensive toy.
polite sage
If you have money, buy Aura One, it have bigger screen, and that mean a lot.
Best route is probably used Glo HD. The Aura One is spiffy, but other than the bigger screen, there&#039;s no reason they can&#039;t put those features in a smaller cheaper body.
I own the Glo model, and I am quite happy with it. I&#039;ve used a 2010 model Nook in the past, and I honestly haven&#039;t found much difference between them. Buy whatever is cheap.
Merciful intellectuals of /lit/, I beg your help! I&#039;ve forgotten the title and author of a short story I read years ago.

My hands were really cold so when I got home I put them down my pants to hold my boner. It felt really good, both on my hands and my dick. I stained my boxers with precum but what else is new? I just sat in front of my computer without turning it on, squeezing my dick for about 10 minutes.

Hitler, Stalin, and Castro were Time&#039;s Man of the Year; it isn&#039;t an endorsement, it&#039;s meant as a recognition of impact
I&#039;d take both of them, honestly, but the bigger the better.
No-one would choose any of this.
These are the best threads on /lit/, faggot. Deal with it.
Hitler and Stalin were both named MotY before the world understood them for what they were. Castro made the cut after the leftist media whitewashed his deeds. It&#039;s an endorsement.
Learn to read, dickwad
Every time I go on Linkedin to compare resumes I end up depressed for days because there are so many people who have far more achievements than me, went to a better school, have higher grades, already working in my desired career after graduating, and 9/10 in physical appearance.

summer time in australia is impossibly lonely. thirty five degree days where you feel like you&#039;re drowning in the humidity. people bustle about in the stupid heat going to the beach or work or drinking with friends. when struggling through the thick molasses of the atmosphere one feels apart from all that even when involved. it&#039;s enough to make you want to die.

I want to read In Search of Lost Time for the prose but I&#039;m concerned the English translation takes too much away from the prose for it to be as noteworthy. I want to read the prose of one of the best authors who ever lived and I hope Moncrieff does it a justice so I can accurately study Proust&#039;s prose.

What shit you smoking m8 people were pissed about Hitler in 35, Sinclair Lewis wrote a book on it even. Didn&#039;t need the 4 gorillion to have understood the grave implications of his rise to power.
It&#039;s not poetry, you&#039;ll be fine.
Calculus 2 test tomorrow. Very stressed
thanks senpai that means a lot
ay I took my calc 2 final yesterday. Easier than any of the tests we had throughout the semester. I believe in you anon.
Look, kiddo. Calculus is just all about memorization. It&#039;s purely computational and formula-based. Basically, what I&#039;m saying is that it&#039;s impossible to learn a semester&#039;s worth of calculus the night before your final.
What are you doing, shifting the collection? Weeding old books? I spend most of my shift shelving, not pulling.
I&#039;ve been studying integration techniques since last week so I should be okay in that department. Infinite series is scary though.
Influx of reddit? or pol?
I&#039;m thinking I need to reduce my internet usage for a while. I don&#039;t really absorb anything anymore, things just pass by my eyes passively. Honestly, I think I do more work just watching the TV. TV is bare minimum. Internet is not even bare-minimum. I end up spending most parts of an hour just flicking between nothing - like I&#039;m opening and closing the fridge the door over and over again but never picking anything to actually eat. I&#039;m only talking really about Facebook and Reddit (don&#039;t shoot me) that just allow you to scroll and scroll and scroll. 4Chan is not as bad, since there is a limit on how much time you can waste here - especially slow boards like /lit/ - and enough of the content is intellectually stimulating enough to be rewarding, but it&#039;s still not perfect. You know, when I was younger I used to make fun of adults who criticised social media. I used to think they were just out of touch and scared of change. But I think they were right. This stuff breeds depression and anxiety. I honestly think there is a real problem that too many people ignore.
*raises pitchfork*
this is such a reddit reply
How do you know what Reddit is like, faggot?
Honestly, I would recommend using social media sparingly and getting a digital subscription to a major national newspaper, one that actually has a reputation. It helps keep you informed with a bare minimum of spin and actual in-depth articles, and you&#039;ll have something for when the craving for stimulation kicks in. I personally use the NYT, but if you think a tiny liberal slant will give you cancer, the WSJ is slanted very slightly further in the opposite direction. Social media sites will legit rot your mind if you aren&#039;t careful, though.

I want to be an intellectually superior being but im mediocre at best. At this point i feel that only a petty mundane superiority is attainable, which is even debatable.
I cut my nails because they get in the way, the way I cling to my pillow looking for something, anything in order to bring warm to this fragile and cold blooded body. I cling to mi pillow as I lay waiting for the bitter dreams that claim my thoughts when I&#039;m sleeping if I sleep at all.

My day today was filled with anxiety, I am scared that my old habits are starting to come back and life is starting to get confusing, like I do not know what to do anymore...I feel trapped, and lost...
to keep this /lit/ related, have you read the Culture of Narcissism by Christopher Lasch? it describes this condition pretty spot on, IMO. he describes what he sees to be the transition from economic man to &#039;psychological man&#039; and that modern culture encourages depression and uncertainty. i identified a lot with it.
I just gotta&#039; keep doing what I&#039;m doing, and hope for the best.
As you can tell, i&#039;m a hit at parties.

I had a comfy day the other day, which I which I wrote about in my day journal (perks or no good friends or family). I&#039;m just posting the beginning of it. If anyone wants, I can&#039;t post the rest later: I stand before a picture of the world below, staring into the light of a lamp post illuminating the corner of a glittering street and the adjacent yards as I slowly and loudly suck tea over the faint whistling slipping through the window&#039;s lips. Nothing of interest catches my eye as I stand in place in front of the glass for a minute or two, enjoying the company of the three foot tall radiator which sits guard, day and night, just before the sill. A thick plume of steam licks at my cheeks before I take another sip of the drink, set it down, and close the window to shut out the morning air&#039;s depressing extremities. Turning away from the frigid foreshadowing, and making my way back into the kitchen, I steal a glace at the time strobing on the head of the stove. Green, boxed numbers flash at me 45 minutes prior to when my alarm had gone off on my phone. I take one last gulp from the tea, and place the mug near the sink as I drift to the car and accumulate myself towards work. The light of the dash glows dimly across my face as I notice the &#039;Change Oil&#039; indicator again...
My girlfriend broke up with me because she said I was making her emotionally jaded. She hated how I was kept talking about how doesn&#039;t read enough or how she chooses to watch TV over decent movies. Also other stuff that she was probably well within her right to point out (ie that I&#039;ve become a boring person).As a result, I&#039;ve found myself coming back to /lit/ and I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s a good thing or not.
idk if it&#039;s worth the effort to into aristotle ive got pretty deep into nietzsche and aristotle is the only philosopher i can come up with to combat his ideas but idk maybe i should shift more to literature and give up philosophy
i don&#039;t get career ambitions. i&#039;m not saying i&#039;m above working, i just don&#039;t get why i should need anything more in life than art, learning, and a few close relationships. my friends are trying to make it to the top of their fields and my parents want nothing more than for me to do the same, but all i want to do is laugh at shitposts, read good books, and listen to my favorite music.
ignoring all the sadness up top, i&#039;m literally sitting at home happy that the holidays are almost here. last school term went well and i couldnt ask for anything more
Well, Im still not sure if I made the right career choise after allHow do I stop being a piece of shit unless I am under pressure? If theres no consequences for not doing something, I never do it. What the fuck.
How can people bear writing in their native languages? Whenever i try writing in Swedish i just cant put my thoughts into words, its so much easier in English. I acknowledge that im not very good at English, but it just makes my text seem more serious and mature. Anyone else experiencing this?
Yes, this is fairly common. You&#039;re probably just less good at judging the quality of English, harder for you to realize how bad and cringey your writing is.
Fuark, I was a biopharmaceutical science major and I dropped out my last year with the same problems you have. I was listening to Peterson lecture and he mentioned that no matter how hard you try to consciously focus and be interested in something, if you unconsciously don&#039;t like it/want to do, it&#039;ll never get done. I sort of feel my whole university career was me trying to force myself to be interested in something and at the very end my unconscious finally snapped.

this makes no sense, do you even know the history of Cuba and what Castro actually did ? He played a huge role in the overthrew a CIA backed Batista dictatorship. Then as a leader he made sure everybody had the healthcare they need to survive and stay healthy. Improved literacy rates drastically by making sure education was not privatized and free for everybody; Cuba is up there with countries that have a near perfect 100% literacy rate. There&#039;s no poverty, nobody is homeless or unemployment. Sure they&#039;re piss poor due to living under a huge trade embargo, but they still manage to get by and make sure everybody lives comfortable- thanks to Castro &quot;regime&quot;
I feel naked (in an essential, or even metaphysical sense) just by thinking about it.
Im writing a short story in four chapters about a suicide, and the suicide only. Just those few minutes before and during the attempt. Ive experienced this quite a few times myself, so i have no problem finding inspiration. Has this been done before tho?
they just dont like giving us monies.
Do you feel naked when you are thinking about sex? Once you start thinking about sex don&#039;t you just do your thing?
There was a Rugrats episode that said the same thing in less than half the word count.
Yeah, you need to get off Facebook immediately. I don&#039;t know about Reddit, but that&#039;s probably bad too. 4chan can be very rewarding as long as you are being active and are here for a purpose. That purpose can be anything at all---even just fucking around, shitposting, whatever. But sitting here and going through board after board hunting for something just to waste time is where it gets bad. As long as your mindful or enjoying something, you&#039;re fine. It&#039;s the glassy-eyed endless scroll shit that is harmful imo.
I&#039;ve been working on-and-off on a short story about a woman walking around the streets of her town all afternoon and into the sunset. Though she never once directly mentions it, she&#039;s decided to kill herself once she reaches the river bridge leading out of town. The fact is revealed in the details of the world--how she interprets and interacts with what she sees, and how aspects of her past are changing in the present and the times these triggers cause her to reflect on her past.
You better hate Plato too then because he is a wordy ass motherfucker.
I feel extremely vulnerable just by imagining me and a girl together naked. More than anything else, I think the feeling comes from the expectation of &#039;performance&#039; or something like it. All my life I was mocked for being a clumsy idiot who never did anything right, how could I do sex right.
I&#039;m just waiting for someone on my third world country to killed me. I can&#039;t do it by myself because I&#039;m afraid someone will saved me or the regret feeling will show up at last minute. So I&#039;m just thinking how its gonna be since every nigger here assault light skinned people thinking they have money or a fucking phone. Maybe they will shoot me or knife me once they realized I have a shit.
That&#039;s the better description of Plato I&#039;ve ever seen. Thanks 4chan.

ugh.... a gradual rise in interest rates wouldnt lead to WW3
no homo, stimulating your prostate while masturbating makes for really, really intense orgasms my diary, desu
As soon as someone writes a children&#039;s cartoon that summarizes Plato.
Oh right. How old are you? First time are always marvellous awkward. I have sex once and it was disgusting. Since then I promised myself I would not do it again. I don&#039;t know, if you are with the girl you really care and she cares about she is not going to bother or even noticed how did you &quot;performed&quot;. Both would be laughing or you will be laughing or even she will laughing but it&#039;s a meaning of being nervous which is normal. (I&#039;m talking about First time, though) I&#039;m not worried about how I would do it but thinking and sort of enjoy thinking about it makes me feel so impure that I don&#039;t even flirt with the opposite sex just for it.
24, ugly as fuck and poor so I&#039;m not sure a girl could care for me to the point she doesn&#039;t mind me being clueless. Maybe we we should seek help.
Also, have you been raised religious?
It deeply saddens me that most men will never know the greatest pleasure their bodies are capable because of social stigma.
My literary video magnum opus.

When I give the exam to my students they groan. They always groan but I&#039;m groaning with them this time. We did not create this exam. It was given to us by a district representative under confusing circumstances two weeks before we were meant to proctor it. Our unit leading to the exam dealt mostly with non-fiction and informational text; the test we received was mostly fiction and poetry.I am now convinced of a link between teaching and alcoholism.
No girl will care if you are objectively handsome once they fall in love. The things come back to reality when it is crushing down. My ex partner used to feel the same way you described yourself . Do you interact outside with anyone? Do you assist to some places that make you obligated to do works with them? It will be a great start if you really want to find someone. And yes, my family used to take me with them to the church and I still doing it by myself just that now without faith.
I can cum from using a dildo in my ass alone, without even touching my dick. It feel really great, women have it better when it comes to pleasure if their orgasms are even better than this.
I&#039;m also clueless about real world stuff, I don&#039;t have a job &amp;c, I can hold conversations pretty easily as long as they don&#039;t ask about me, then I&#039;m shameful of my life. Finances, hobbies, house management, this is all so confusing to me. I think I&#039;ve been helicoptered my whole life and that took its toil.
I&#039;m definitely not trying to blame anyone for my failures though, this is my responsibility to fix.
Anon, I will like to still talking with you. Do you have an email account so I can contact with you?
The Buddhist framework calls this the &#039;transcendental period&#039; where you at a time where you are deciding on action. From here you can correct or fix many things and also destroy many things through your actions and thoughts. What would you do during this period?
I don&#039;t know why this keeps happening to me.They don&#039;t.
A throwaway?
Thanks, capitalism.
Yes, sure.

I don&#039;t discourage you from writing your story though, because I think there is a lot of room for difference. But check out Patriotism, its a short story too and well worth the read.
find a cause? production is not manufacturing? identify with that self beyond the self, what you find in others; no obligations, her arm draped across your stomach, and your eyes widen in the darkness as you come to a thousand illegible conclusions. these proofs have no solution.i just want to know i&#039;ll have another chance.
I do this too desu. If you want to feel better about yourself, read the craigslist personals.
v. jealous, I&#039;ve only been able to do that once and it was indescribable.
I dream of finding a girl that is into pegging.
please go back to plebbit
Sorry, Satan.
this, desu
I can&#039;t read because the TV is too fucking loud.
feels bad man not intelligent enough for reply
Life hasn&#039;t been this good in a long time. I study law, train and read books in my spare time. Recently I&#039;ve taken control over my non-existent emotional side and begun to talk to people at my school, and my two friends are happy to have me back as a person again. Outside the snow is starting to fall and I&#039;ll just sit here in my small apartment and read books all day. Maybe I&#039;ll even talk to that girl I like tomorrow.
Pegging is a godawful plebeian fetish for retards.
If it makes me cum I don&#039;t care.
Unironically a fag
Skelfr Yggdrasils askr standandi
Pegging is pretty sophisticated imho.
are they as hard wearing now?
Why don&#039;t I want to sleep? There is no reason, I am not enjoying myself.
I believe I am physically and mentally repulsive to others and I am deeply, deeply ashamed of myself. This feeling remains regardless of how hard I work or how much I improve myself. I am top of my class in electrical engineering at a good university, I dress well, I eat healthily, I go to the gym everyday, I read a lot and I&#039;m very well spoken.I cannot shake the feeling that no one will ever want me, not as a friend or a lover. I feel destined to die alone and I feel like there&#039;s nothing I can do about it. I have been clinically depressed for as long as I can remember. I don&#039;t think I have ever felt happy to get up in the morning.
Keep on showing the world what a depressed person can do, anon.
Professional pornography is so fake is hard to feel stimulated by it, amateur videos only make feel sad. I haven&#039;t had an orgasm in a month.
You should it&#039;s fun. The 320 lb girl I had was still the one of the best.
Fuck thai ladyboys instead
Feels good man
stop watching porn
I did, that&#039;s what I implied.
I decided I&#039;m not going to kill myself, but I don&#039;t know why. If someone asked me why i&#039;m still alive, I wouldn&#039;t know how to answer them.
How about finding a partner then?
It&#039;s okay. You don&#039;t really need an uplifting reason to stay alive. If you feel depressed, go run any do any sport, read, write and go out. There&#039;s no worse prison than loneliness, especially in a casual environment like your home.
Nice
Unlikely, to say the least.
I can&#039;t handle following along with politics and the news about what&#039;s happening with my country. It&#039;s destroying me. And I can&#039;t just &quot;shut it down&quot; and try to ignore everything.
There&#039;s no going back after Stirner.
You&#039;re literally a faggot if you do otherwise
I use a cucumber with a condom on. I don&#039;t even have to &#039;beat it&#039;.
Thats small talk, retard. What the fuck do you want strangers to start a conversation with?
I feel exactly as you do, word-for-word. I am tall, funny, and very confident/socially dominant (though not a chad). I feel worthless. It feels like no one would want to be around me if i wasnt in entertain mode. When i have shown some insecurity to people in the past, i have received no support. Peoples entire opinion of you changes. This makes me use entertain mode more and more, which makes me more insecure about myself. This then leads to more confrssions with people, looking for a connection. But the greater insecurity turns them away every time. Its so strange. The cycle needs to end somehow. Fixing this is the main concern of my life because it will mess up any friend/relationship i could possibly have and having a good one of those would mean the world to me.
i don&#039;t want to die or suicide, but sometimes i feel like i should just fade out in thin air and be completely forgotten by everyone who ever met me
The real me is repulsive to women.
It never made sense but now I don&#039;t feel it has to anymore.
fetishes are for plebs
Will we eventually lose our humanity?Or have we already?
Don&#039;t worry. It will all be over soon.
What does humanity mean?Specify what aspect of the human condition you are referring to, and how you are perceiving society to move away from it
Today I overheard a conversation between three old men in a bus stop.One of them spoke with conviction about the Syrians. The resolution, obviously to him, was to nuke the whole thing.
That would technically resolve the conflict. You could also just steamroll it in the old-fashioned way and set up a colony, which would probably kill less people
nah, we&#039;ll just change its definition
depends on how much you valorize primitivism
We&#039;re still featherless bipeds with broad, flat nails. I doubt that will change for a couple thousand years.
i want wings fucklord
we could go either way at this point. We could transcend the limitations of humanity and move into a realm of pure ever deepening creativity, a cybernetic dreamtime, a return to the mythical, magical, integrated world of our ancestors. Or, we could sink further and further into commodification until it sucks away all of our humanity. A war without hate, war as pure technicality, is the most inhuman and terrifying thing one can possibly imagine.
losing our humanity would mean death. if we are alive that is a human possible form.
i think there are some very disturbing psychopaths in silicone valley we should be concerned about.
You will die befour that happens
Humanity is a human construct, we are all biochemical computers programmed to rape the universe into submission.
Depends what you understand by ,,humanity&quot;.
We&#039;ve already lost it. You need level 5000 autism to succeed at anything these days. 
every day of my life i focus on being less of a human being and becoming some sort of emotionless insentient being, because there are some aspects of my life that i fucked up (and also, there are some fucked up things that just happened and isn&#039;t my fault) so hard the only possible way to move forward is ignoring all my feelings, they were dragging me down
the distractions of the screens and their movie-content projections are distracting us from developing stronger, more connected relationships with our families, so kinda?
I don&#039;t think it matters. I just want virtual reality so I can dive into it and never come back out. It would be the most comfy way to commit suicide.
i&#039;m too depressed already. i don&#039;t need to see this
If you&#039;re on 4chan chances are you already have.
We didn&#039;t even find it yet, Anon.
The transistor was a mistake.
we never had it to begin withwhy do you think women have periods every month?
To give them a break from my dick.

Thoughts on this masterpiece? What was Ahab&#039;s problem?

i long to hear you away your rolling river. Oh mody dick i long to hear you . away , i am bound to go cross the wide missouri dam, i too a notion oooooo away the rolling river. to sail across the stormy ocean away i am bound to go
says i but joe you&#039;re ten years dead. I never died says he
His problem is the same as everyone&#039;s problem. He needed to prove he was top dog. It&#039;s the same reason when a bear or mountain lion kill a person, usually park rangers or someone goes out and kills that animal. Humans can&#039;t stand the thought of being overpowered until they&#039;re in the bedroom, and then they&#039;re all rape me rape me someone please rape me. I don&#039;t relate to humans very well.
Has there ever been a single second in /lit/&#039;s history where there hasn&#039;t been at least one Moby Dick thread?
How can Americans even compete?
I wrote an entire novel without using any words
By not writing half baked gimmick trash lit.
ya but his name has about 4 of themfuckin fag lol
JUST FUCK MY SHIT UP
by writing a novel without the letter é
It&#039;s not hard you just try using lots of ings, most words can ing inging in no timing.
CRASH fuck me.
retard op
he definitely has the facial hair of a guy who would write an entire novel without using the letter &#039;e&#039;.

perec is kind of the meme king, his ideas are all interesting in theory if you describe them to other people but awful to read
he also grew a beard despite his obvious lack of testosterone
kek
B, P, E, F
You best be fucking joking you utter sack of shit
I know he have a sweet beard but if you read any of his books, you will love him.
slide a piece of paper labeled with a word with that retarded cousin of a phoneme occurring more than once in it to speakers of latin-based languages from different places and you won&#039;t find a coherent sound among them
I&#039;ve read &quot;Things: A Story of the Sixties&quot; but I wasn&#039;t impressed. Or not as impressed as someone who recommended it to me was.

Just read &#039;W, or the Memory of Childhood&#039;, it&#039;s excellent
pretty funny OP
kek
Americans are unable to compete with the Russians and the French. They aren&#039;t even in the same tier. Its like comparing an Ivy League school with a community college.
There&#039;s 4 like right in his fucking name, stop it already

If his name is Georges Perec then wouldn&#039;t it be on the cover? Therefore defeating his own goal of writing a novel without using the word &quot;e&quot;.



et Marc Edouard Nabe bien sur.

That&#039;s called lipogram and has been done since the greeks, you idiot. It&#039;s not a new thing.
I&#039;d say David Bellos who translated it into English could probably compete. Thats got to be at least 9000 times harder.
Thanks, I usually rate my books based on number of e&#039;s in them. This will only be like no. 5 tho cause this hack still had a bunch of them on the cover.
Is this worth reading casually? As in, I&#039;m not trying to become a fucking war strategist.
luckily for you that requires an actual technical military education and not just flicking through a book of very short, millennia-old aphorisms
Well that&#039;s too bad buddy because once you made your way through this gem of roughly 100 pages you will rival the likes of Napoleon, Caesar and Alexander the Great whether you want it or not.

There is nothing casual about this book. I read it on the bus and instead of going to work I accidentally conquered most of Canada.

It may make you a better Total War player but aside from that you won&#039;t become a military strategist.
I honestly don&#039;t mind that I didn&#039;t get a real answer because the replies have been so good
Canadias are easily dominated

I&#039;d say so. It was quite interesting.
Only if you are a narcissist.
Similarly, my copy has an introductory section almost as long as the book on ancient Chinese military doctrine and equipment. Will I miss anything if I skip it? I&#039;m not interested in the historical aspect, but rather how I might apply the content to life.
In that case, save yourself the effort and read Thomas Schelling instead. Might be on sale some places since he just died.
There&#039;s two main lessons to pull from this book and apply to your life. Don&#039;t fight chariots head on and don&#039;t charge up hill.There&#039;s no need to thank me for saving you 20 minutes of reading.
book is good, can apply it to everyday interactions withh people , can see alot of it in how chinese people/business/society function diplomatic, strategic, cunning etc..
Fucking elites trying to keep me from breaking free from my Rousseauian chains. The matrix is real guys and philosophy is the cure. Start with Descartes, then go to Hume, Plato, Empiricists, leviathan, social contract and then to Spinoza. Kant will give you the details and german idealism will give you the fire. I&#039;m getting there guys.
My cat just knocked my copy of the sublime object of ideology into the trash. I had just dropped several cum covered tissues in the trash and now my book is all cummy. What is the universe trying to tell me? I feel there&#039;s some symbolism here.
PURE UNADULTERATED MEMEOLOGY
Your cat is telling you you suck at philosophy.
Thanks to animism.
the universe wants you to ditch this pseudo philosopher and get a worthy book, such as Atlas shrugged or The Fountainhead

My cat died in my arms.
I nearly 8 your b8
Gave me some serious thinker tinkering for a futuristic murder mystery with sentient weapons. Short story acourse.
Which writers weren&#039;t massive numale faggots or women? I watched Nocturnal animals and a serious man recently and realised that Jews and gay men are the only people able to contribute to culture these days.I saw a book sale at the library and noticed a lot of female authors of fiction. I wouldnt bother with these out of principle because they have had easy lives and are literally adult-children. Though the best book ive read in the past year was by a woman so maybe my thesis is wrong.
Stay there you fucking racist, sexist virgin

Someone asked yesterday who the Thomas Pynchon of film was here and someone postulated Godard but I objected that Godard isn&#039;t funny in the way Pynchon is.Just look at Dr. Strangelove and Gravity&#039;s Rainbow. Incredibly similar themes and comedy.
Kubrik is the Vonnegut of film. There is no equivalent to Pynchon
Colgate is the Kubrick of toothpaste.
Pynchon is the DFW of literature.
Bounty is the Spielberg of paper towels.
Woolf is the nectarine of fruit
Perhaps the closest equivalent isn&#039;t to be found in a movie theater at all, but rather in another of Pynchon&#039;s beloved media: television. I see more in common between The Simpsons and Pynchon than any single filmmaker.

He&#039;s not funny either, though.

There isn&#039;t room in a 90-165 min. movie to really do that variation in style. Paul Thomas Anderson is the closest to what you describe, and he even did a pretty heckin gooofy adaptation of Inherent Vice.
This. The movie got me into reading Pinecone.
Kubrick: DeLillo
So why does Ajax kill himself anyway? Yeah, he fucked up some sheep and herdsman or whatever but like so does every war hero?
Couldn&#039;t live with phimosis any longer.
He was really good at everything except that he didn&#039;t speak so good so nobody recognized his achievements.
No he had the intention of killing the generals and regretted it deeply after coming to his senses, so he killed himself for muh honor
Didn&#039;t he kill himself because he lost some contest to Ulysses?
Couldn&#039;t live without sweet Achilles boipussy
Not a contest. Agamemnon gave Odysseus Achilleus&#039; armor even though it was Ajax who went out and retrieved Achilleus&#039; body (thus it appeared likely that Ajax deserved the armor).

Living the life that he led - is Céline a prime example of anti-Romantacization?What are /lit/&#039;s thoughts?
i bet celine nutted inside a lot of beautiful french women and some algerians
what exactly are your question?
Nabokov on Celine
i don´t know, nabokov have a too sensuous view to calibrate the literature. it fits in my world that celine doesn´t count at all to him. it doesn´t surprise me.
You don&#039;t understand what a discussion is?
there, i said it
Favorite unknown author(s)?
Define unknown.
Homer
Paul Butfield
My wife&#039;s son is a pretty talented short story writer
Miguel de Cervantes
Me

Robert Rankin. Not unknown, but not widely discussed, either
I don&#039;t know
Anyone else feel this way and/or have a dissociative disorder?
Don&#039;t worry anon, lots of people have autism :)
Help me win an argument, /lit/. What is more elitist; to study economics at a ivy league school or study applied maths at some unknown university?
I don&#039;t know what&#039;s more elitist, but I know what&#039;s more useful, and that&#039;s all that really matters. Your argument is pointless.
That, OP, is elitist.
Obviously the one that involves prestige and a future salary.
spicuous_leisure
And this is exactly what I want to do because I&#039;m aware of my own incompetence. I know there is little I can do to change my circumstances, so I shouldn&#039;t feel bad for wanting to pursue my interests, no matter how useless, but the guilt always stops me dead in my tracks anyway. &quot;I shouldn&#039;t be doing this. I should try to do something more productive.&quot;
For me ennui is synonymous with suicidal ideation. Can&#039;t fucking do it. Gotta keep busy.
And given OP&#039;s question, which is more useful?
Useful to whom? Yourself? The world? Your family?
The answer to your question is applied math.
Studying economics at Ivy League school will get you a one way ticket to Wall Street and 100 hour work weeks. You&#039;ll make a few hundred thousand if you survive till 30 and bonuses but you&#039;ll probably be miserable.Millionaires and billionaires are always forgotten by time.
I like this. Can you please elaborate?
All of the above.
They are forgotten because that is what they want. Being seen is just an impediment to the power their wealth affords them.
There is a lot of happiness to be found in family, in relationships and in marriage. But elitism is not happiness, in some ways it is the antithesis.
But how is this different from a NEET &quot;studying&quot; computer games 24/7?
It isn&#039;t. Video games are a kind of modern elitism.
Hey, that&#039;s exactly what I&#039;m doing. Is there something wrong with that?
the more i re-read this, the more i like this
god help us all
You know what you must do, OP.
Can any one explain how to achieve , but at the same time becoming financially independent? Should one dedicate oneself to learn math and patterns and move to a remote luxurious villa and trade the markets?
bump for interest
Most of us will die in a bath tub alone in some microapartment, and our bodies won&#039;t be discovered until weeks or even months later, when they have almost completely decomposed. What are you talking about?
how financially stable are you trying to be? because your best bet for living like that is to eschew modern comfort in favor of more intrinsic pleasures
i&#039;m talking about making money so that i dont have to live in a microapartment and being free from common society.
You&#039;ve reached new disconnected zeniths anon, truly you are king of all
i want to be ahead of the bell-curve. i want to buy time by having an assistant, maid and cook, and never again having to queue in the bank, hospital or at the airport.
Well, god speed

That&#039;s beyond stability—that&#039;s entering into cushioned comfortability—you bougie fuck—start accruing assets bitch—broke ass motherfucker

i am
Both are elitism.
greenwich, CT
but if i where to view market analysis as an art, and sacrifice other ambitions (kids, loving family, many close friends) for it, but still have to goal of earning lots of money, what would that make me?
Why is every post on this board pretentious pseudo-intellectual garbage?
but is lacanian monism and but so?
A Jew
We are all pretentious on 4chan, but in /lit/, at least, we don&#039;t pretend to be retarded
I did not read Foucault, in fact. I intuited it myself, just as he did.
economics = applied math. Pure math is the only patrician option
I think we have a winner.
with that logic, everything is equal to everything.
none of those acts are elitist
Sooo..... economics?
I hope you know that unless you&#039;re in some degree of an executive position, those jobs aren&#039;t exactly fun. It&#039;s competitive as fucking hell and everyone treats you like shit until it becomes clear that you&#039;re actually valuable to the firm.
get rich, pleb
Elitism has nothing to do with knowledge.Americans and their fairy stories. Try real hard and I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll let you join their club. Not.
Guys i&#039;m scaredIs he gonna come fuck me in the ass too?
Stop this meme. He doesn&#039;t fuck the kid in the ass. Somebody here posted a great article written by a Dartmouth professor who argued persuasively that The Judge breaks down and cries in front of the Kid and apologizes for all the wrong he&#039;s done in his life and begs forgiveness. Let me try to find the link.
when the fuck was that from?
There is no way in hell that could have been what happened
The scene immediately afterwards where the cowboys stare into the jakes in extreme horror totally negates that theory
Ya but it&#039;s Dartmouth- Workingman&#039;s State School: The Ivy
sick restaurants in Hanover tho

Judge and kid rape and kill the missing girl
well?
Yup.
step up, dartmouth
There is a simple explanation for that. You see, the Judge had come a bit too late with that paper...
Nope
all is well
I always assumed the third man talking outside the bathroom was the kid
Such faggotry going on here,
Holden was a good boy, he never hurt a living soul.
He only appears in chapter 7, when Glanton&#039;s gang buys a bunch of Colt Dragoon revolvers and Glanton goes shooting around.
ITT books that everyone knows of but no one has actually read, except you actually did and have no one to talk about it with.
Also nice trips satan
I was trying to decide between it and infinite jest
Sounds good. I actually haven&#039;t read it in years so I&#039;ll probably read along. I&#039;ll have to get my copy back from my grandpa.
Will there be threads or is it over discord? I could get in on this.
For both of you: the thread&#039;ll be up this saturrday night (gmt)
Threads bud
thanks for the heads up
How fast are you guys gonna read it?
Pretty fast, but manageable. The plan is 25 days, roughly 50 pages a day.
in for that
ordered mine for my christmas, I&#039;ll make a thread about it when im done.
What happened to Phenomenology of Spirit?
Didnt know there was a phenomenonogy of spirit readthrough planned.Wouldnt that need a ton of background reading though?

/pol/ is too retarded to read this and properly understand. They keep jerking to loli and trump.
Not him, but I&#039;ll answer: Yes. A decent knowledge of the History of philosohpy and specially Plato, Aristotle, Spinoza, Leibniz, Kant, Fichte and Schelling. You can read Hegel before the last two as long as you don&#039;t skip them at the end.
Also, i&#039;m gonna keep an eye open for the readthrough, i might chime in every once in a while.
Finished it yesterday. Read the Maude translation, Denisov&#039;s Elmer Fudd like talk was hilarious.
I should note that I think that his points about history were definitely much more salient at the time of publication. But now people more or less take it for granted, at least in academia, that Great Man theory is a sham. So to me, the premise was at once something I already accepted, and it was argued entirely too repetitively in my view, albeit being important to the nature of the story.
What is the book even about? I&#039;m entry-level and I just find it hard to wrap my head around 1000+ pages of stuff going on. Most I&#039;ve read is like 4-500.
Do we have a timetable?
I have multiple friends that have read war and peace. I&#039;m the only one that have finished Don Quixote, and I&#039;ll rather discuss that one.
This is for the Oxford World&#039;s Classics edition. I&#039;ll produce a version that has chapter numbers instead of pages once my uni exams finish (which means Friday night I&#039;ll do that, if all goes to plan; Saturday at the latest.)
Thanks, can&#039;t wait to relive the friendship from all those years ago when we read Infinite Jest.
best translation?
damn I wish I had the book, sounds like a comfy winter book to me

Do you have any idea how many people are intending to participate?
maybe you need a better class of friend? this usually happens in college/univeristy, though, where you meet people with similar interests. so if you&#039;re not of that age yet, you&#039;ll soon find out weeding out the dumb asses you befriended during childhood or high school or because they lived in the same neighborhood as you is beneficial to your quality of life. if you&#039;re skipping out on going to college/uni, then you&#039;re shit out of luck, mate.
i hope this is real, im totally in for this
Lots of rich russians whining about love, lots of Napoleon doing his Napoleon stuff
Well I just turned 30 and never attended college. So much for that.
wtf
Not a clue. It seemed quite lukewarm at first in the initial thread, but a lot of folk seem enthusiastic now. So hopefully a good number
i was leaning towards anna karenina but this is a big motivator
this sounds like a great excuse to (re)start with the greeks. would anyone be down for a grand philosophy readthrough? the only question would be to include plotinus, boethius, and aquinas ...
Damn. I&#039;m already committed to reading The Count of Monte Cristo over Christmas. I&#039;d want to get a nice hardback copy of w&amp;p but I can&#039;t afford it at the moment. Hope you guys have fun, and hey, if anyone wants to do this same thing but with TCoMC then you would definitely have me involved.
i am up for it too
OP here. I&#039;ve actually have an untouched copy sitting on my book shelf for years. Maybe not a bad idea.
which edition should I buy for this readthrough?
ayyyiii am in
Oxford World&#039;s Classics ideally. But I&#039;m gonna make a progress chart that uses chapter number instead of pages when I get time, so people can use any edition. The only thing is that I&#039;d recommend the Maude translation over any other translation.
What&#039;s up with the lines separating days? It looks like every five days or so?
Holy shit that&#039;s actually an edition you can get off libgen. In nice shiny epub, too.
When you say &quot;starting next Saturday&quot;, d&#039;you mean start reading on Saturday, or have read the first fifty pages by Saturday?
grr i&#039;m too poor to afford the book so I&#039;ll be using the ebook, therefore won&#039;t know exactly where to stop reading/how long i need to keep reading for.
But six books sounds like quite a lot to juggle at once so it&#039;s really up to you whether you want to join in. I can&#039;t read more than two books at once.
Thread will be up Saturday night (gmt), so probably best to read the first fifty pages on the Friday if you&#039;ve got time.
Fug
Fixed.
So it&#039;s only a problem for the first day, and I can just tell you that we&#039;re reading up to chapter 12 for the Saturday night.
nice
Seems to me everyone knows at least some of Grieg&#039;s accompaniment without knowing the actual play. It&#039;s a shame because I consider it one of my favorites.
Nobody I know at least. It&#039;s been 9 years already, shit.aroque_Cycle
I&#039;ll give it a go. Read the first fifty pages and check out the Saturday thread. It&#039;s a lot more reading than I usually do of one book -- usually I do maybe twenty pages for a book in a day. But maybe that&#039;s not such a bad thing.
Yeah, that&#039;s part of the appeal of these sorts of readthroughs. Because you&#039;re reading alongside others and towards a goal, you really do almost always overshoot the number of pages you think that you&#039;re capable of reading in a day. I remember having that feeling about Gravity&#039;s Rainbow when we had the readthrough of that.
Not anyone I know, at any rate.
I read both friend
Is &quot;War and peace&quot; a good advice as well, if we don&#039;t count that &quot;less bias&quot; line?
Yep pretty good account of the Napoleonic War and a great look at Russian society (mostly aristocrats) at the time if you don&#039;t mind all the anti-Napoleon Russia-did-nothing-wrong shilling. Also it is really good.
I&#039;m surprised no one has mentioned Ulysses. It seems like most people just accept that it&#039;s one of the greatest books (in English) of all time. Yet, almost no one ever actually reads the whole thing.
I liked when Quixote rekd a buch of puppets
It&#039;s in the meme trilogy nigga, most people here only read those 3 books
I reckon plenty of anons read half of Infinite Jest and called it a day.
Man I just want someone IRL to talk about it with
I, too, enjoyed the clergy-clobbering scene.
People are not gonna stick to this. Whether they should be able to notwithstanding, the average /lit/ user will not keep up this pace.
For most of War and Peace, it&#039;s action and conversation, not a lot of complex stuff, so 50-60 pages is only an hour to an hour and a half&#039;s reading at what I imagine to be the pace of your average /lit/izen. And like I say, if people really have problems keeping up, it&#039;ll be apparent from the start and we can adjust to a rate people are comfortable with.
It&#039;s a mix of an oerview of aristocratic life in napoleonic russia, the history of the invasion, an essay on historiography and philosogy and a classic web of romance.
I&#039;m gonna try to stick to it. From what I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s an easy read (for a 1200 page book) so I&#039;ll probably try to stay 20 pages ahead to give myself a buffer for the rough parts.
I think I&#039;d like a Psychopathia Sexualis next. There&#039;s a shop which has one I think but I don&#039;t care about some old musty edition, just having a good working text.
I&#039;ve never touched Infinite Jest or Gravity&#039;s Rainbow but I shitpost about them all the time
He fucking owned Hector
None of mine either though
Absolutely nobody, which is a shame
I hope you know you&#039;re writing in-character.
next saturday as in 24 of december?
I am totally down for this, when do we start? maybey the pace is a bit too high?
NpaN_TkgM/pub
Sorry if that&#039;s too early for people to get a physical copy of the book, but the edition I&#039;m planning on using is on Gutenberg (the maude translation), so if you&#039;re in that situation and you still want to take part, you could make do with the online version till your physical copy arrives.
Is there anything I should read before War and Peace?
Guise, should I read Notes from the Underground or L&#039;Étranger before we start W&amp;P?
Or some essay from DFW?
Nah, you can pretty much launch into it. It&#039;s not a book you really need to prepare for.
I read DQ at 13 so I remember jack other than him being a general idiot and his sad, sad death.
I&#039;m glad /lit/ still has these kind of actvities, count me in.
Wait til after Christmas you douche, I&#039;m getting my copy then
Ebooks my man.
I&#039;ll be there dude
I&#039;m not sure about this translation, guys.

What you guys think of creating a group in goodreads for the people doing the readthrough? i think it would be nice to gather together the people doing it..so if anyone create a group in goodreads, post in the next thread and I and possibly other anons will join it
Why though. And not all of us will have an account.
Eh, no translation is perfect. Tolstoy especially is an ambiguous case in terms of translation. It&#039;s not like Proust where we all know the Moncreiff translation is best. But the man himself supported the Maudes, so I think that must be worth something.
I&#039;ve done AK already this year.
I know he vouched for the Maudes himself, but the French &quot;translation&quot;...it&#039;s a straight-up rewriting. Removing whole phrases, adding others in.
That&#039;s gay though...
Brace yourself for the next few books.
i never understood the appeal of group reading, book clubs (other than to meet women), or read-alongs - all versions of the same nonsense. reading fiction is a solitary practice and should remain forever so. i also cringe when people gather to read a book for some reason they think they need a support group to finish. Infinite Jest, Gravity&#039;s Rainbow, and War and Peace come to mind.
Hmm, that does suck. I guess it just goes to show where the translation meme comes from. I don&#039;t really see any way round it without learning Russian though, since all the other translations are so contested (especially P&#039;n&#039;V).
Here&#039;s the appeal apart from those things: to discuss material with people going through it as you are, in order to generate ideas foreign to yourself with people who have the same vantage point (i.e. are at the same point in the book, without having read it before) as yourself. Why wouldn&#039;t that be enticing?
to be honest, i think that&#039;s what college/university is for. that&#039;s when you acquire all the tools to adequately criticize a text from multiple perspectives. i am not against book discussions, per se, but the requirements and regulations set upon the reader for the sake of discussing the text. i think readers would get far more enjoyment from a novel by reading them at their own pace and discussing it with friends and acquaintances who have also read the book. or maybe i&#039;m just a contrarian grouch. i&#039;ve never had any enjoyment in the book clubs friends dragged me to, so i speak from personal experience, and probably shouldn&#039;t be paid any mind. if you dig them, go for it.
I&#039;ve never participated in one before, but I&#039;ve had some good conversations with people on here and will most likely participate in the War and Peace one for at least a little bit, and the reasons I&#039;ve given are the reasons why I&#039;m willing to at least give it a shot. What do you think?

I am excited to do this readthrough, never did anything like this and never discussed books with anyone. The few people I know, at best, read authors such as Stephen King and don&#039;t even know who is Homer or Joyce or Alighieri or Goethe or Dostoevsky or Tolstoy or Nabokov is, so basically, this is board is my &#039;/lit/ friend&#039;, so why not give this good ole friend a chance to read a book &#039;together&#039; and discuss it?

I think you like to start your morning with a large dose of outrage.

A girl lives in Bramladesh. I am very geographically close to the girl. I wish to become friends with a girl and convince her to help popularize my poetry through a girl&#039;s social media outreach. Once I have gained sufficient outreach I will subtly slander and undermine everything the girl stands for through my writing. A girl deserves as much.

Actually read this recently. Short read, obviously. Simple poetry. Not good. I liked maybe two poems. Most of it is bad. Few good lines throughout, which were all ruined by thie following lines. She just comes off as self-centered, and very few of the ideas are new.
Probably a good tool for getting into artsy girls&#039; pants
but the whole thesis of the book is that men are possessive in nature and that you should just get another woman to lick your taint
It&#039;s like all the shit poems kids write in my CW program. She has an idea of what a good poem should look like, but doesn&#039;t understand what actually makes a poem good.
made me cry desu
theres enough good lines in it to make like 1 decent poem

I just started coming to /lit/ because I wanted to get into reading books. Was this a mistake?
I fuckin hate reading
i can&#039;t read anything after finishing Don Quixote
hahahahahahahahaha no, you&#039;ll fit right in with some people who came here three years ago.
Just read the Classic and come here sometimes. It isn&#039;t worth to stay a long time in this board. Unironically it makes you waste your time than encourage you to read.

What&#039;s the point in living if you can&#039;t understand the sciences? How to deal with just not being smart enough to do anything that really matters? Suggest philosophers who dealt with how to stop worrying and love mediocrity. No stoics pls.
RIP, what a lovely human being :(
Reassess your ideology you simple child.
Possibly solipsists
 Believing in science creates more productivity, so I assume that&#039;s why it&#039;s more valuable in a societal vacuum?

can you be an intellectual without engaging in the world of academia?
Hey litizens, we&#039;ve maybe all felt it, perhaps the closest we come to feeling out of our minds. Jealousy, when the deficiency we feel on ourselves manifests as a fearful need to prod our outside world into control.What are the best books you&#039;ve read on the subject of or that deal thematically with Jealousy? So far I dig The Kreutzer Sonata, the relevant bits from Proust, and Orlando Furioso is quite nice
My diary desu

Seeing as this De Assis dude is quite esteemed in portuguese, there any English translation you rec? If only one, what would be lost?
bumpAlso open (as you can see from the post pic) to any films on Jealousy, with the top tier ones being perhaps Eyes Wide Shut and Raging Bull
Proust.
Anyone else has gone through that same experience?
no
I said &quot;sodomic&quot; though.

Nope, never been a fag before.
Similar. Substitute &quot;occult&quot; for &quot;Christianity&quot; and &quot;PhD&quot; for &quot;literary award&quot; (obviously I wrote analytical crap rather than fiction of my own).
Is this still accurate or it needs an update?
These are good entry level books. There&#039;s no need for an update
even still we should update it so that at least newfags will make threads about something else for a while
It should probably have books you can actually talk about on here without being told to go back to rebbit.
Not eurocentric enough, I need to jerk off over my fading relevance.
Why?

could lose lord of the flies and TKAMB. Also Lolita isn&#039;t really a starter book
Needs to be renamed to &quot;Books you should have read in high school,&quot; a list for people to catch up.
There&#039;s this one.
How is it not?
y tho
this is a starter kit for literature
Never liked invisible man. bashed readers over the head with themes one too many times
i mean, it&#039;s not that hard (catch-22 is probably a more difficult read) but the prose is top-tier, and the subject matter and concept of the book is a little heavy for a starter. doesnt belong on the same list as Fahrenheit 451, cuckoos nest, etc.
that is to say, if you&#039;re a &quot;starter&quot; who will actually go on to read better, more advanced works, you don&#039;t really need to pick an easy book. If you need easier books to start you off, you read random stuff in high school
A reasonable amount of the people on /lit/ don&#039;t seem to have any idea about how to interpret Lolita. Someone new to reading isn&#039;t going to grasp Nabokov&#039;s intentions for the purpose of art. Not to mention the book has sizeable amounts of untranslated French and is wordier in its English vocabulary than almost anything else on the list.
Is this a good list for non-native English speakers? I read some books on this list, but they were translated and I&#039;m thinking on starting to read the originals. My English is ok, but for example, I started reading Dubliners and that was quite difficult, a lot of vocabulary I&#039;ve never seen.Is there any list of this kind?
Consider that these books are perhaps too difficult for a starter.
Too anglocentric.
this is stuff they teach in american high schools. you have to go to uni to get a less anglocentric reading list desu

/pol/ is leaking again.
Or Orwell, Hunter S. Thompson...

Yeah I like that one much more than the the one currently.
Why are the charts so ridiculously difficult to navigate? Everything takes an hour to load. Theres too many hyperlinks on the same page. Why do we need a chart for Cape Verdian /lit/? Narrow it down to some kind of coherent logical framework besides: here is everything we fucking know about literature ! ! !
why? Those are perfect starter books
does /lit/ recommend any icelandic literature?is laxness or the sagas worth looking into?
Brennu-Njáls Saga is okay
&quot;Trymskvida&quot; by Snorre Stulrason is pretty good desu. The story of Balder&#039;s death is also quite good.
Read the first chapter sitting on a rock near Reykjavik. Transformative.
Started Independent People a while back but got bored after the second chapter. When does it start to pick up?
Once you get past the wedding and the shepherd&#039;s meetings things pick up.
I picked up Laxness while I had a layover in Keflavik airport and I was pleasantly surprised. Definitely worth getting into
sounds comfy

Philosophy is garbage.
are you saying philosophy is garbagewhat did he mean by this
Are you trying to say that philosophy is ideology?
What IS garbage?
I am already eating from the trashcan all the time
No, you&#039;re garbage!
All things become trash over time.
He&#039;s saying it&#039;s garbage. If he was mocking, he would have greened.
so we pretty much have to assume the greentext or assume OP doesn&#039;t know how to use the costanza meme
No, no, ontology is garbage. The rest occasionally has some practical application.
Yes and no
Ontology is literally the only salvageable facet of philosophy besides Ethics

I think about garbage therefore I am.

Socrates was literally a neet that wandered between peoples baths shitposting. He shitposted so often he was executed for shitposting.
Socrates was the single worst thing to happen to human civilization.Rationality was a mistake.
Stupid frogposter.
If Socrates was on 4chan all he would do is reply to someone with a completely unrelated topic and use it as evidence that the person was wrong.
That&#039;s Plato&#039;s fictional self-insert called Socrates, not actual Socrates, the latter was based.
Socrates was an autist
Socrates actually existed. Multiple contemporary sources wrote about the man.
how do you know that
He should be our example. A frogposter killed by normies.
I&#039;m a wizard.

Nietzsche looked up to Socrates

I think there&#039;s this revisionist tendency in the history of ideas now to leap from the fact that our second-hand account of some major historical figure isn&#039;t entirely factual to the belief that it&#039;s almost entirely fabricated.

“Let me tell you about memes” That&#039;s what he said as he brushed the seamen off his shoulder in a swift flick of the wrist. He was a tall man, with a short face, and a short dick. So short infact that he had won many a dick measuring contest. But not the l o n g di ck contests. The short dicks ones. Because he had a small penis. Not a big one. That&#039;s the sort of man he was, or woman, I suppose I don&#039;t know really, you never know these days. Every other guy says he&#039;s some sort of trans octo trampoline cow humper with a bipolar arm. People can&#039;t seem to decide. And when they do decide, they make poor decisions. I know, because I make all of the right decisions. I never see anyone making similar ones. I guess I’m just ahead of my time.
The pancakes burst out of the prostrate Golden Retriever with an unnatural CRASH across the kitchen floor while God, my Mother, laughed. I knew this was a serious situation, but the final boss theme of Kefka from Final Fantasy 6 (3 in North America) was playing insistently in my head. &quot;Holy--&quot; I spluttered.
You sound like Pynchon&#039;s wife son.
His first words were cancer. They were also his last.
&quot;Hahaha!&quot; said God (Mom).
Fill a brother in on what&#039;s going on in this thread.
Felt forced. Who are you trying to impress anon? I hope it&#039;s not us, and I hope you don&#039;t think you&#039;re being funny. You failed at both.
rude this is nice board
.
&quot;God fucked Ulysses in what might as well have been his ass&quot;
Whoa calm down buddy
Soon, I could eat no more. God, my mother, the dog (a Golden Retriever), and the pancakes all vanished, along with the world. There was only voidness and me. I looked at my body. It was not a human body. It was the color of a blueberry suffused with light, wide and flat, and had text on it. With horror I realized I was a 4chan post. A series of them in fact, and that all I had taken for granted was elided unreality. I saw the replies. This was it. This was me. Somewhere, someone must be writing me - I hoped, I prayed, if only to have a real God to curse. But if my very concept of what a 4chan post was came from a world that never was, who could say? &quot;Fuck you!&quot; I said, anyway.
The rudeness was started firstly by invoking me to read his garbage prose. I believe that whatever anyone writes on here is worth reading but forced memes and the people who perpetuate them should hang by the neck with the weight of the convictions that brought them here in the first place. Pray they find their convictions not as heavy as they believe them to be.
no
Are you some kinda no good hacker?

&quot;Mother&quot; is one word, so saying &quot;They were also his last&quot; is incorrect.

Tbh I&#039;ve been on /lit/ for a few years and not even I really understand what&#039;s going on here.
Ebooks vs Books. Which one is better? Why?
fuck off
Nice.
Both are good. Ebooks for travelling and getting books easier/cheaper(even if you legally buy them) especially if you decide you want to start reading certain book but its night so cant really go buy physical copy at that hour. Also its nice to read in bed since e-readers are light and don&#039;t need to fight with the book to keep it open with right angle and still lay in a way you want to. But then again there is something very enjoyable when reading a physical book and holding it in your hands. I also would much rather get physical book for christmas than an ebook. And some classics are just nice to hold and turn the pages
Though I do love me the feeling of flipping through paper and smelling the smell of a well-used book that I&#039;ve read cover to cover multiple times.
My Kindle can&#039;t replicate the weight of a physical book or the smell of the pages. Conversely, I feel like an idiot when I instinctively try to touch my finger to a word on a page in an effort to look up the definition.
It&#039;s like trying to CTR+F a word in a textbook or a quote in a novel and realizing that you&#039;re not on a computer
Neither. Just read free pdfs on your laptop or phone and stop paying money for shit you don&#039;t need.
Reading on a PC/Phone screen ruins our eyes though.
used to do this. It was fucking awful
It&#039;s a good feeling sitting back in your chair looking at your bookcase looking, admiring, and thinking on all the books you&#039;ve read on that case. A damn good feeling.
You&#039;ve been brainwashed by &quot;e-ink&quot; merchants. I&#039;ve been reading this way every day for years and my eyes have never felt &quot;strained.&quot;

Oh, also Renzo De Felice&#039;s 4,000 page biography on Mussolini is renowned, but I do not believe it&#039;s translated from Italian.
I just started Swann&#039;s Way, and its so hard to read. (In german btw) Is is worth it to keep reading?
Is lost time really seen as difficult?I&#039;ve read swann&#039;s way and a bit of budding grove but I gave up since it&#039;s so damn long, not because it was difficult.
It&#039;s not even difficult you dingus, it&#039;s long-winded, that&#039;s why people approach it with caution. And yeah, it is fucking worth it, but it&#039;s more of an adjusting of your own mind, Proust will write in the same style for all seven volumes.
didn&#039;t meant hard that way. Sorry my english is not perfect. I was talking bout the style but thank you
Why don&#039;t you ask yourself, since you&#039;ve read part of the book. Read a bit more, novels need some time to integrate you into their language. If you then still feel that the payoff for...Why am i even writing these kind of posts...
Yes, it is extremely worth it (I&#039;ve read it in portuguese btw)
Yes. In Search of Lost Time is one of the greatest literary works of all time.
I&#039;ve only read Combray and loved it. Give it some time and don&#039;t read for the plot because it doesn&#039;t exist.

he wrote in french and translated his shit to english after. doesn&#039;t count as a frenchie though i agree.
Can you tell me what is the publishing house of your book?

Not a meme.
I tried reading a book in the original language once, just to see what it&#039;s like being a pleb, and it was a suffocating and nauseous experience. I pity those for whom there is no other option.
Maybe for you anglophones. But a book translated from English is still a good book, since every language is better than English

nice you read the bare minimum to post on thsi board
Have you seen those screenshots of the english translations of it? I don&#039;t have any saved, but Finnegan&#039;s Wake had at least oregano Joyce prose to it, Bottom&#039;s Dream is just something fucking else
i came here to shitpost but this is more or less correct
Nothing Euripides wrote compares to the Oresteia or Theban Plays. Not even the Bacchae.
Yeah, right.
any particular reason why?

I want this meme to end

You keep telling yourself that pablo
because the three that survive are from different retellings of the cycle....
The fucking Schmidt meme, my sides
I have. Everything on your list, and thousands of other books.
also absolutely lacking the wake
confirmed never read DUBliners, the big U, and is definitely NOT WOKE
My mother tongue is Hebrew.
no Infinite Jest though?
No play is worth reading or watching. What can you learn from it.
O B S E R V E D

Greek religion.
Wtf I hate Shakespeare now
Why don&#039;t you accept the truth that there&#039;s no God?
t. Plato
Because i don&#039;t accept delusional fantasies as the truth
Why do you have a problem with a Bible there but not with greek myths stuff?
Also, Greek/Roman ml mythology is , depending on the translation, fascinating to read as stories whereas the Bible is a stylistic mess.
And now take a look at Christianity and the Islam where Protestants and Catholic or Shiits and Sunni slay the fuck out of each other even though they believe in the same God, but interpret the words of some madmen who sat in the desert writing stuff on a piece of parchment, differently
holy...i want you to go back to r/atheism
Yes, I am an atheist, I&#039;m a clear mind that doesn&#039;t need the words of some lunatics for guidance. I&#039;m still interested in Religion from a scientific point of view, I&#039;m fascinated by how religion can and does influence people, societies or the law.
I hear Eugene Onegin is only worth reading in Russian. Or maybe I just read a really shitty translation because I wanted one in verse. Think I&#039;ll give Nabokov&#039;s a go.
Protip: both liberalism and scientism are religions.
I know most people criticize it for being overly long libertarian drivel, but I have a feeling that I&#039;d agree with many of her ideas. I&#039;ve read a fair share of better regarded classics (Proust, Kafka, Faulkner, Camus, Sartre) back in high school, but have stopped reading due to uni. Are these worth a read and are they enjoyable? Is the criticism of Rand driven by political agenda or is it actually tedious and in-your-face philosophizing?
just get the fountainhead
because it&#039;s shorter?
because i don&#039;t like the other one
reading atlas shrugged and it&#039;s dreadful. She repeats herself to oblivion.
you can read it for free on line you massive goofballl
I have to read ~400 pages of the Fountainhead tonight for class tomorrow, and I honestly want to kill myself. -capitalist, hardcore atheist, or enjoy reading endless bland descriptions, you might enjoy both books. If you just want to learn about objectivism in general, just research online or watch Rand interviews.
What book(s) are worth learning by heart? So /lit/, which words should they be?
Entire books? Literally noneClosest is the bible
the gregs - my diary
(Not that I disagree with you necessarily, it&#039;s a genuine question, not rhetorical).
i love this question. but it is so subjectiveeee
Still some long-form documents which seem to me to be worth memorizing (in large part, if not in their entirety) are the United States&#039; founding documents, which are of course quite short.
hes memeing hard - if serious would have nemed a BOOK of the Bible
I know most of Hamlet by heart in the same way you do rap songs. I&#039;m lucky to come from a bookish family and have a good memory, but I&#039;m guessing a very good knowledge of Ham;et isn&#039;t all that rare.
Don&#039;t learn the whole thing by heart, but remembering a couple soliloquies from Hamlet won&#039;t hurt.
Chaucer&#039;s general prologue is a pretty common piece of lit to memorize, if you&#039;re into that stuff
any good poetry
I don&#039;t know how true it is by I&#039;ve heard that Thomas Aquinas memorized the entire bible so I&#039;ve been trying to do the same. I&#039;m obviously nowhere near as smart as him so I&#039;ve just been working on a single verse per day. I figured it would be neat to see how far I could get along.
القرآن
Which translation are you memorizing?
I think it&#039;s RVS. I use the Didache bible.
Dictionary
So far we have:
THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

Impressive but not unbelievable. Not much else to do for fun back then.
For a Christian the four gospels are probably the most important. There&#039;s no need to bother with the genealogies or other annoying things in the OT like the tabernacle or Solomon&#039;s temple at all.
Apparently it was when his family was kidnapping him and holding him prisoner to discourage him from joining the Dominicans so he certainly didn&#039;t lack any free time. He is such a fascinating dude.
mnemonic techniques like the memory palace or overlaying imagery makes what youre looking to do perfectly achievable. A good place to start is &#039;art of memory&#039; by frances yates, or any thing by Mary Carruthers which goes through the history of memory in the medieval ages. You gotta remember that for a long time memory was the cornerstone of the rhetorical education everyone was getting, so while memorizing scripture or long documents was still relatively difficult, it was an expected task that many people did.
fuck Im illiterate
Drinking, whoring and killing your enemies are perennial. Sure, if you can do all that and memorize some (perhaps relevant) Bible verses, all the more glory to you.
Yet, as the author of that article himself states, it is tedious and long work to commit lengthy passages to memory. I think this method combined with spaced repetition might just do the trick.
that is entirely up to you.how are a bunch of anonymous strangers going to know what books are personally meaningful enough to you to the extent that you&#039;d want to memorize them?
-pointing to all of the above on a map/table as needed
Would go for the Divine Comedy, the Iliad or some Shakespeare desu.
Thank you! I just used that method and for the first time have memorized a part of a poem. Only took about 10 or 15 minutes to get it down.
You&#039;re welcome!
Another good thing to do is to connect a place to at least one real, interesting thing that I know about it. I used to forget Wiltshire all the time when doing the counties of England. But once I realized that Stonehenge is in Wiltshire, now I don&#039;t forget Wiltshire anymore.
Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan (the really hard-to-spell meme-ones. A guy at an old job had some army t-shirt with a picture of a mission to Kyrgyzstan. Bishkek sounds like Kek. Azerbaijan is the third thing over by the caucuses).
Any good poetry desu.
ing_(psychology)
The only long thing I&#039;ve memorized is the Pale Fire poem. I&#039;ve never recited it to anyone (of course), but it&#039;s great to go over it in my head whenever I feel like it. I almost have Waiting for Godot memorized, but that was mostly for acting, so it&#039;s hard to count it. I&#039;d say memorize some of Shakespeare&#039;s sonnets first.
*here and there... and shouldn&#039;t have used the expression twice. My b.
Grenada-Barbados-Bahamas (single-words. Rihanna. Tourism for Americans in Bahamas.)
When you memorized Pale Fire, did you also memorize punctuation and line breaks and all that? Or do you only memorize the words and the &quot;feel&quot; (i.e. the tone you would use when reciting it) of the poem?

I mean yeah, you don&#039;t start a religion without your message being powerful
Sasha Grey&#039;s ass is ten times more powerful desu. Moves the soul
I feel that writing about religious/spiritual writing is more powerful than the religious writing itself because it becomes unpacked, examined, and measured but now that I&#039;ve typed that I feel slightly autistic
You&#039;ll try, but you&#039;ll fail.

As for &quot;civilized religion&quot;, we see lots of animals at Gobekli Tepe, with seems to indicate a truth that one must be thankful for the bounty of the earth, and fearful of what it can do to you.
I think it was only partly ironic. I know /lit/&#039;s interest in religion has come off as pretty sincere a lot of the time.
fuck off already, reddit.
It&#039;s the same reason Marvel movies do so well. Except those still suck and can&#039;t really capture purity of virtue like scripture can. Also appeal to broad audience has really killed movie quality in the last decade or so.
See how /pol/ users haven&#039;t really known what to do with themselves since Trump won. They&#039;re not used to winning.
I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s not sincere (my original point stated the opposite). I&#039;m saying it began as an act of rebellion and desire to be different from their peers. The views espoused are only whta they are because the accepted norm was to champion the opposite.
ancestral bear cult ftw
also bear in mind that it is in fact an anonymous forum full of lonely, unfulfilled, knowledgeable, people. It is an environment conducive to sincerity, and not everyone is so knee-jerkingly offput from religion as you and your smug buddies. Many people are ready and willing to accept that science is retrospective and therefore insufficient
how long have you been lurking here, for real?
Is Modern Writers, everyone since Eliot, Melville being the last classicist writer in this regard, has been struggling with self integration amidst a collective integration. Gaddis believes this is found in the self within our process of disintegration, but who knows?

I&#039;m trying to suggest that fedora atheism is the norm in youth internet culture.
by its monthly tendencies
I can only speak for myself, but I&#039;ve been lurking 4chan for 10 years and I only just recently began to reject the nihilistic philosophies that dominated my youth. It has nothing to do with being counter-culture or rebelling against anyone, nor did my initial drift towards nihilism. It&#039;s simply a matter of maturing, and gaining new insights through living life, reading, and observing.

Approached cold these texts are pure shit.

Christianity is only concerned with personal salvation to become part of a nebulous afterlife for which no evidence exists, and for which this world needs to be sacrificed, which is best expressed in the way early christians like Martin of Tours refused to fight enemies of their nations, insofar killing in this world could cost them heaven... he is not kidding, or meaning the opposite, but actually setting down a morality where the world is a lie and only the afterlife is the real deal, so destroying your life in this world, &quot;carrying your cross&quot; as he says, is completely logical
Only a person that does not actually believe in the Heaven for the persecuted, the meek, and the martyred would actually re-interpret Christianity as a cult of earthly power which declares &quot;the strong shall inherit the Earth&quot;, &quot;my kingdom is of this world&quot; and &quot;you must destroy the enemies of your nation&quot;You can tell your children that Jesus wanted them to be earthly warriors because &quot;I didn&#039;t come to bring peace&quot;, but you can&#039;t stop them from reading the rest of the paragraph and realizing what Jesus wanted is for them to put christian morality above the good-being of their own families.
You can tell your children that Jesus wanted them to be earthly warriors because &quot;Buy a sword&quot;, but you can&#039;t stop them from reading the next chapter and realizing that Jesus stopped Peter from using the sword to fight and defeat the romans, and reprimanded him for misunderstanding, all while asking him to carry his own cross (Peter, fully realizing that Jesus meant all the stuff about embracing death and his kingdom was not of this world, that angelic chariots were not going to slay his enemies and bring him victory, realized he was doomed, and would then deny Jesus 3 times)Sooner or later, your &quot;strict catholic crusader&quot; state will be reformed into liberalism, because the Gospel will still exist, because your children, like Peter, will realize that Jesus meant it when he said &quot;you are to be persecuted and martyred for me&quot;, that Jesus didn&#039;t say &quot;you will live in a stable and powerful civilization, free of oppresion and death, thanks to me&quot;.
but what do I know I&#039;m an unread brainlet so fuck it
This is pretty accurate. &quot;My kingdom is not of this world.&quot;

Tao te Ching. No memeing.

Something she would enjoy
Ever since I found my mom&#039;s copies of 50 Shades of Grey stuffed beneath her mattress I have refused to treat her as a human being, let alone a literate one. I refuse to let here even kiss me on the mouth any more since I&#039;m sure she has oral herpes. This year I&#039;m buying her a cilice with her own money.
Venus in furs
would a middle-aged upper class white woman enjoy this?
None. Women only like to read popular garbage, see goodreads.
A dildo
Bought my mom The Waves by Virginia Woolf this xmas.Get her something you think she&#039;ll enjoy that you could see yourself enjoying as well. Simple as that

Charlotte&#039;s Web
I got mine fear and trembling. She&#039;s going through a Christian phase and she can at least do it right.

Try Robyn Carr or Jodi Picoult novels.
It&#039;s actually good too and moms love it.
why were the mario chapters the best chapters?

As long as we agree Orin&#039;s chapters were the worst. But really, I found Don or Hal&#039;s to be the best, I just found the narrative in them pretty fun.
it&#039;s weird I really didn&#039;t like Don. I didn&#039;t mind Orin.
Mario&#039;s were great. So we&#039;re PGOAT&#039;s, so we&#039;re don&#039;s and Poor Tony&#039;s
dunno, the only ones i love from the book are from don and the ennet house. maximum comfy, and that showdown is off the wall fantastic

Mario is the Alyosha of the book. He&#039;s the most pure and, outward appearances notwithstanding, the most normal. He&#039;s the emotional and (with Gately) moral core of the book
kek fuck you
I agree with this
The Orin chapter about how he lied about killing to family dog was good.
what did Dave mean by this?

Gave up half way through that, should I try carrying on?
p.s. the footnotes get longer.
I liked Marathe a lot though
Dont waste ya time. Read Oblivion instead.
That fucking gif holy shit
Unironicly my favorite chapters

really enjoyed those 2bh
Schwarzkommando sections were my favorite to be honest senpai
gately was the best character. Hal was far too two-dimensional. yeaa i&#039;m smart, yea i&#039;m good at tennis. yeah there&#039;s nothing else interesting about you.not to go all dear diary but i also really enjoyed the chapter, relatively short, where peemster tries to convince hal to take drugs again. kind of reminiscent to my, like, situation where my friends laugh in my face and call me a weirdo when I say no to going to social smoking sessions; Because when I do I get sucked into a vortex where I need to be intoxicated every second of the day or I&#039;m miserable otherwise.
reminds me a lot of myself also.
What the fuck was her problem
I liked the ebonics
can&#039;t keep her legs closed lmao
Also: the comfy wintermorning in the dorm of the ETA.. Accept for the one kid&#039;s forehead being ripped off.
I actually read the comfy morning chapter with almost exact same conditions outside. Sitting by the fireplace with a coffee for max comfy
I liked that part a lot, very spooky
disgusting

Oh fuck I completely repressed my memory of that chapter, what the fuck was that
sides, orbit, et but cetera
It turns out that 17 goes into 51 way more than 3 times (or whatever the exact ratio was, which I can&#039;t seem to find atm)

I liked them. Some of the more straightforward chapters in terms of addressing themes
Did Orin get caught and interrogated by the AFR at the end?
Yeah but he lives. Says so in the first few pages. Nobody really knows why.

To be honest, I feel sorry for you senpai
*sniffs*
The opposite, it&#039;s Mario&#039;s anormality, that is signified through his appearance, that contrasts the normality of the people surrounding him, which are suffering under the american culture of cynisism, performance pressure and sarcasm.
Shitty reading of Hal&#039;s character. A tip: Sometimes, after a longer passage or a chapter, or even after a sentence, stop reading and think about what you&#039;ve just read. This way your judgement of characters me rise above what you&#039;ve just written.
Didn&#039;t like these very much. All of the commentary on American life felt ve4t juvenile and forced compared to the rest of the book
any time the Peemster shows up makes it the best chapters
Pemulis is objectively the most based character.
btw, w2c yachting cap?
Mostly because of Browser&#039;s (sic?) character depth
The first chapter/corresponding end note for the ridge scenes confused the fuck out of me on my first passing. Quadruple agency was too much for my pseudy brain
Consider: the Entertainment is actually just a baby&#039;s POV looking up at Joelle saying &quot;I&#039;m sorry&quot; again and again

...from which all communications abruptly cease
It was now, beyond any shadow of a doubt, snowing.
Kittenplan&#039;s face was a Toltec death mask.
Nobody like to think about the fact that Carol Spode had used the one exact same Wilson racket for her entire time at ETA.
&quot;Waive something shiny in his face.&quot;
Ok I get this whole picture except the &quot;Too Late&quot; red line Was the thing the attaché watched the original cartridge?

Hal, Gately &amp; co. were too late to find the entertainment because Orin already had it.

Steeply/marate chapters shouldve been cut
Describe hal&#039;s personality
t. pleb
He doesnt mean mario is the most average, he means mario is the most sane. Hes right about that and about mario being the book&#039;s alyosha.
Pleb? lol. They were the chapters that spoonfed you the book&#039;s themes. They&#039;re also written in an annoying &quot;Frenchy English&quot; style because marathe is in the scene. Not to mention michael pietsch, the guy who edited the book, agrees with me. He wanted them cut, saying they were the scenes he was least looking forward to rereading. In the end, he caved to wallaces stubborness.
Pleased to see an IJ thread with people actually fucking discussing the book for once
I feel like I need to reread the Maranthe/Steeply convos, but yeah, at first go, they are the least interesting (aside from some of the minor Ennet house denizen&#039;s episodes)
I wish I hadn&#039;t rushed through the last two hundred pages

Thanks for reminding me anon.
why was one&#039;s life referred to as a &quot;map&quot; and why was conversing called &quot;interfacing&quot;?

I am a bricklayer by trade. On the day of the accident, March 27, I was working alone on the roof of a new six story building. When I completed my work, I discovered that I had about 900 kg. of brick left over. Rather than laboriously carry the bricks down by hand, I decided to lower them in a barrel by using a pulley which fortunately was attached to the side of the building at the sixth floor. Securing the rope at ground level, I went up to the roof, swung the barrel out and loaded the brick into it. Then I went back to the ground and untied the rope, holding it tightly to insure a slow descent of the 900 kg of bricks. You will note in block #11 of the accident reporting form that I weigh 75 kg.Due to my surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly, I lost my presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope. Needless to say, I proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the building. In the vicinity of the third floor I met the barrel coming down. This explains the fractured skull and the broken collar bone.
The encounter with the barrel slowed me enough to lessen my impact with the brick-strewn ground below. I am sorry to report, however, that as I lay there on the bricks in considerable pain, unable to stand or move and watching the empty barrel six stories above me, I again lost my presence of mind and unfortunately let go of the rope, causing the barrel to begin a

The Moms&#039; letter to Orin is modeled on &quot;Letters From Mamma&quot; or &quot;Things Are Fine In Mt. Idy&quot; collected as a book, written by &quot;Charley Weaver&quot;&#039;s Mamma, Weaver a fictional character created and played by Clifford Arquette.
There was in fact a lethal traffic report helicopter crash which did kill a female reporter, which happened in the years prior to IJ&#039;s initial publication.
...Gately supine with his side on fire while newcomer Joelle v.D. raises her veil slightly to lick the sweat off his lids and temples, whispering to the veil flutters around and fans him, promising him a P.M. of near-terminal pleasures, undressing at the foot of the old tall bed , slowly, her loose light clothes moist with sweat and falling easily to the bare floor, and an incredible female body, an inhuman body, the sort of body Gately&#039;s only ever seen with a staple in the navel, a body like something you&#039;d win in a raffle; and a fifth post forms on the four-poster, so to speak, which erect post&#039;s long dormant height obscures the nude newcomer&#039;s figure; and then when she moves around out of the pulsing shadow to lean in close and press her inhuman body&#039;s face right up intimately close to his, she removes the veil, and on top of this body to die for is the unveiled historical likeness of fucking Winston Churchill, complete with cigar and jowls and bulldog scowl...
Dornacker
Orin&#039;s chapters were my favorite. Fight me.
if it&#039;s one of conversations between Hal and Orin you absolutely ought to read it. They&#039;re hilarious and pretty important to the story, if I recall correctly.
I thought map meant face
yes, autistic people like dfw struggle to read faces
&quot;map&quot; was supposed to be bostonspeaknot being from boston, idk whether it is or not
What are you even doing on /lit/?

i live in east Boston and, along with Southie, it&#039;s where that excruciating accent is at its worst, and i have yet hear anyone use &quot;map&quot; in that way
From what I remember map was slang influenced by ONANs Canada/Great Concavity related political boundary fuckery
This. The highlight of the footnotes in my opinion, and it totally surpassed any other slapstick elements of the work.
I had a giggle

Yeah orin is pretty based desu. He probably gets the most in-depth psychological profiling in the book.
Ollster, boys: seminal, visionary. An outstanding experience. I now say things like outstanding instead of boss. But also seminal. Ollie, men, I saw something outstandingly visional and seminary yesterday. I do not refer to the football game. I normally don’t much get into football. All that grunting. Mud everywhere. Not my scene ordinarily. The most diverting single thing of the game was one of the two teams’ punters. This one slim cat with an outsized leg and slightly less outsized arm. Never saw punts I could hear before. Whoom. Blam. I ate an entire wiener stem to stern while one punt was in the air. People stood around conferring and making a racket and going to the restroom and coming back and eating concessions, all while this one cat’s punts were still in the air. What was that cat’s name again, R.T.?
ODpt79Ak
it&#039;s just dfw talking about himself. boring.
I ate this.
I read,” I say. “I study and read. I bet I’ve read everything you read. Don’t think I haven’t. I consume libraries. I wear out spines and ROM-drives. I do things like get in a taxi and say, &quot;The library, and step on it.” My instincts concerning syntax and mechanics are better than your own, I can tell, with all due respect. But it transcends the mechanics. I’m not a machine. I feel and believe. I have opinions. Some of them are interesting. I could, if you’d let me, talk and talk
John Wayne is of the sock-and-a-shoe, sock-and-a-shoe school.
I was telling my girlfriend about that part of the book, and making fun of him. Later that day, I ended up doing it, and she gave me shit for quite some time.

SECYOTTY!
Please commit a crime.
Took the words right out of my mouth
i liked the bit where Hal is in his room doing something and bunch of his dormmates come around one-by-one and just poke their head in for a moment then leave without saying anything
mmmyellow.
Was Mario modeled after the Chaplain from Catch 22?
Lenz described the Hog as a primo example of what he called the Polish Curse, viz. undistinguished length but sobering circumference.
the Don Gately chapters and the one where that other Ennet House guy is killing the cats and dogs were the best by far
the best chapters were the ones that described JOI&#039;s films
My favorites were the chapters with JOI&#039;s dad. &quot;Jim not that way Jim&quot; followed by a lesson in respect for objects, the influence of Brando on subsequent generation&#039;s unstudied care, the loss and misuse of potential, etc. That chapter stuck wth me more than any. The chapter when they are fixing the bed was just hilarious as well
lol the nun film. so silly
when peems imagines hitting freer on the head with a wooden club and the cartoon-style lump popping out he he
But what sent his face clear down off his skull and broke him in two, though, was he said when he saw the Pam-shiny empty biscuit pan on top of the stove and the plastic rind of the peanut butter’s safety-seal wrap on top of the wastebasket’s tall pile.
Uncomfortably like a mirror in some passages, and terrifyingly like a prophecy in others.
This all the way. I bet DFW would have been a great filmmaker... I wonder why he never tried? He probably could have got funding pretty easily given that he was such a well known name
I actually thought Lenz was JOI and JOI had faked his death until he started killing animals. Since his last name sounds like &quot;lens&quot; and as I recall he was described as looking like he was wearing a disguise
That sounds like a terribly idea honestly. His dialogue is so unnatural and so much of the action in his fiction is inside people&#039;s heads. Plus his best tricks all had to do with language and form, which simply do not translate to film.
typing that out though, i wonder if i didn&#039;t miss the point in some way
YEAH. Where is that full passage? It crosses my mind almost every time I put my shoes on, because I do that and I never considered anyone would find it strange. I mean, I got my foot up on my other knee to put my sock on -- why wouldn&#039;t you just take care of the shoe while you&#039;re at it?
----the two have this bit they do on spaghetti night where McDade comes into the living room right before chow and goes &#039;Some of that extra-fine spay-ghetti tonight, Doonster,&#039; and Doony Glynn goes &#039;Ooh, will it be all lovely and soft?&#039; and McDade goes &#039;Leave your teeth at home, boy&#039; in the voice of a Kentucky sheriff, leading Glynn to the table by the hand as if Glynn were a damaged child.
My favorite parts too. Being in a garage and dropping books on the floor when your dad tells you to put them down and a dust cloud comes up is so vivid in my mind
i found it very sad and slightly moving hearing about JOI&#039;s dad&#039;s injury.
is it just me who&#039;s finding it difficult to read other books after finishing IJ? When will this pass?
See for instance Wayne, who’d been in their room right after lunch when Pemulis had made the decision to come up for some pre-match Tenuate. Wayne’s room was right nearby and he was standing there over Troeltsch’s pharmacopic bedside table with no shirt and wet hair, rheumy-eyed and shiny-nostriled from moisturizer on his Kleenex-chafed nostrils. The Viking was squeezing a damp tennis ball with his left hand while he scanned his forehead by mostly feel. Pemulis’s psychic counter-strategy was not to appear in any hurry to dress and stretch and get out there either. Pemulis — who feared and hated unauthorized people being in his room, and who was constantly on Schacht’s back about forgetting to lock up when he left, and who wasn’t intimidated by Wayne’s talent and success and affectless reserve, but was cautious around him, John Wayne, sort of the way a formidable predator will be unintimidated but cautious around another formidable predator, particularly since the virtuosic but tense performance in a certain administrative office a week ago, which had been mentioned by neither man — had coolly asked Wayne if he could help him, and Wayne had just as coolly not looked up from rattling through sickly Jim Troeltsch’s bedside table’s stuff and said he’d come in for some of Troeltsch’s Seldane e , which Pemulis had indeed heard Troeltsch at breakfast describing to a nose-blowing Wayne as the battlefield-nuke of anti-histamines that didn’t make you too drowsy to function at an incredibly high level of function. Pemulis adjusted his jock’s rear straps, trying to remember this Wayne-memory’s point. Wayne had wanted a clear head and high pulmonary function because he was down to play the Syrian Satelliter in an informal exhibition at 1515h. Wayne hadn’t offered this explanation; Pemulis got it off the e-board. One reason Pemulis was cautiously unassertive about Wayne’s unauthorized presence in the room was the leaflet, which given a certain office-incident it wasn’t impossible Wayne might choose to suspect seeing Pemulis’s hand in the Olde-English-fonted leaflet up at various boards and inserted on the E.T.A. TPs’ communal e-board for 11/14 announcing a joint John Wayne/Dr. Avril Incandenza arithmetic presentation to the pre-quadrivial 14-and-Unders on how 17 can actually go into 56 way more than 3.294 times. The point was that the half-dressed Wayne had been standing there with one foot bare and one in a sock and shoe. Pemulis shook his head slightly and looked down at Possalthwaite and tried to gather spit.
i dun geddit?
with fiction like this (i dont know what you&#039;d call it: high-fiction? i dont know) like, by very intelligent people, do you not just feel like the words/sentences/stories/whole book is operating on another higher and completely different plane of meaninganyone else feel this way and/or know what/if youre suppose to do anything about it?
does anyone else feel like infinite jest/dfw ruined their life, or at least contributed to it?i mean i have depression anyway, but he makes me feel like its impossible to connect with anyone ever again or at least made me aware that it was always difficult
can anyone clear up what time period the interview between hal and his dad happened and why his dad keeps imploring that hes not saying anything when he is?
JOI was a massive autist and thought Hal&#039;s relationship with him was like his relationship to his father

you connected with him tho :)
wait a minute: does /lit/ actually like this book? I thought we were just memeing.
I like individual sections
Same for The Pale King. I really didn&#039;t understand the book&#039;s plot, and it felt very disjointed. But there were some parts that I really connected with. After digesting it, I find that the parts I didn&#039;t quite get were worth dredging through to get to the parts that affected me in a deep fashion.
Four 12-year-old kids shoot up in a warehouse in the Bronx. One never does it again. Two may try it on and off for the next few years, no big deal. The fourth – well, the fourth is an addict that very day, gets the Dis-Ease. Nobody knows why. It ain’t chemistry, it ain’t personality, phobias, upbringing, ethnicity, education, poverty, depression. The Dis-Ease is in the Substance, and it’s in the person, and when the two meet, they are bonded for life.

what is some literature that will make me believe in beauty, the good, and make life worth living again.

It&#039;s just a history book from a left wing professor who got disillusioned about his own Nationality and Zionism in the light of history.

Joyce called Tolstoy&#039;s &quot;How Much Land Does a Man Need?&quot; the greatest story in our literature. 10-15 pages.
Just read it. Was very good.
I just read Moravagine and ran into the russian habit of &quot;sitting on the oven&quot;what does this mean? What is the oven they&#039;re referring to?
Not literally sitting on the oven, sitting in a room heated by a stove
It&#039;s literally sitting on an oven, but I can&#039;t really explain it to someone who hasn&#039;t seen an oven or sat on one.
moravagine falls asleep on the oven for two days at one point

wow that looks cozy
Per the footnotes, russian ovens/stoves had large flat tops for those who wished to sit on/sleep on something warm
It&#039;s not like a cooking stove, it&#039;s like a big block in the corner of a room built into the wall with a bench for sitting on it. My grandparents house has one. You fill it from outside by a hatch, light it, and the heat warms the bench and the room.
Yeah I should have posted a picture, but instead I drew a shitty MsPaint illustration kek.
yeah i still couldn&#039;t really picture what that meant
The moral is one will never be satisfied if they can&#039;t live with what they have already, for they could always obtain more, right?
I thought the moral is &quot;when you have the opportunity of a lifetime, plan first, and move with a purpose.&quot; The protagonist did neither, raced to finish it at the end, and ended up with nothing.
good Lord, tell me where you&#039;re from so I know never to go there
the moral of the story is that the will to power is a hell of a drug.
That&#039;s a beautiful last sentence.
He still only needes six feet. The old him would have known better. He could have taken half of what he attempted and lived a life of contentment, but he lost sight of his needs(6 feet). Everything beyond those 6 feet should be seen as a blessing, but he lost that footing and it cost him everything.
Thanks for the chuckle, mate.
Do your have it as a pdf/epub? Been looking forever.
I think it was mostly &quot;muh greed&quot; but if I were to chose a secondary theme it would be that of &quot;home.&quot; The image of a traveler being buried in a foreign land always evokes sadness and homesickness, and here I think it brings together Pahom&#039;s misconceptions about land. There&#039;s a sort of sentimentality he feels for it after his first acquisition, the stuff that grows there feels special to him, but he loses that feeling in sight of further riches. The land becomes merely a thing to labor on and eventually sell, and he&#039;s willing to get up and move his life over and over again without a second thought. Wherever he goes, he views the townspeople as annoyances and quarrels with them rather than befriending them. His only really associations seem to be with travelers who speak of riches. So, his place of living never becomes much of a home. It&#039;s just a place to live for a while. That image of him in a grave in a foreign land, which would normally evoke such a sad response in the reader, begs the question: Where else would they have buried him? Here is as good as any other place for a man with no connections and no home.
&quot;Ah, what someThe Bashkirs. Then here, I could not yet done thought he. &quot;Busy&quot;
This. Absolutely.
The moral is that to actually to live a moral life is good while neverending search of spirituality leads only to folly and death.
Rustic Propaganda by a literary prostitute. Why did he hate the city life so much? Fucking idiot.
The central tenet of Georgism is that land and natural resources are a public resource and should not be owned exclusively by the wealthy. George advocated for reductions in taxes on productivity (sales, income, and capital gains) which would be replaced by a land tax on the base value of a property.

Why? He&#039;s an academic.

Georges Bataille&#039;s The Story of the Eye
All of the most edgy shit that always gets named, Bataille and Peter Sotos and the Nazi stuff, you can get all that at any college library. The real fucked up degenerate shit is self-published erotica
Admittedly that is by far the most entry-level and least CIA-arousing of the books on Nazi occultism on that list, but it&#039;s intended for a more casual audience anyway.
Mein Kampf, the quintessential edgelord book.
How? Varg himself is edgy but to my knowledge the book doesn&#039;t overtly push any sort of agenda. You wouldn&#039;t get put onto a watch-list for purchasing MYFAROG so I don&#039;t see how a book he wrote about Scandinavian religion is going to attract the attention of authorities.
How hard on a scale of 1-2 is it to learn Ancient or Koine Greek?Anyone done it?
I&#039;d say 1 if those are your metrics.
I meant to put &quot;independently&quot; in the OP.
HardIt&#039;s an OK language to learn if you&#039;re willing to put in the hours and you&#039;ve already learned Latin. But by yourself there&#039;s a high risk of burnout, for the average person.
tldr: If you plan to learn Latin and Greek both, I would strongly suggest you do Latin first. But Greek absolutely can be done if you are very dedicated.
And do you like Greek?
Greek has been highly rewarding but I&#039;ve been very dedicated
2, definitely a hard 2
Pretty easy. Just a lot of memorization. As for quickly reading and understanding itd prolly take you atleast a year but prolly more.
it was pretty hard, though
I just recommend Latin because it&#039;s like Easier Greek. It&#039;s a lot less top-heavy with memorising conjugations, so you can get into reading more quickly, which makes pacing and motivation ten times easier. You will get past the hump of &quot;am I even making progress?&quot; in Latin a lot quicker. And so much of what you learn will transfer over almost identically. Even chunks of the conjugation are similar to Latin (in a fuzzy way, but one that helped me when memorising it). Ultimately, I think there are few people out there who have Attic Greek but no Latin. If you care enough about Antiquity to read Greek, you probably care enough to read Latin too.
I like Greek but I need it for specific reasons and I&#039;m an autistic faggot. On that note, sorry for the longposting. Autism.
Koine Greek was a major language of learning for not far off a thousand years with substantial amounts of texts being only partially (if even that) or very dryly translated (because it&#039;s only meant for academics). If you are the kind of person who is nerdy enough to want to learn Koine Greek there is going to be an endless series of things for you to read.

You, OP, may or may not be able to learn the externals of the language--the grammar, vocabulary, syntax, and so on--but your heart is definitely not in the right place to deal with what the Koine has to say.
Go to bed, Phil.

Moretz is built like a spartan
She&#039;s cute.

lmao its gondola
Whenever someone mentions Greek people talk grammar but the hardest part of Greek is vocabulary. Almost none of the words look familiar and you just have to brute-force your way through a few thousand words to get anywhere near reading comfortably. And every time you start a new author you&#039;ll have to memorize at least a thousand or two new words that show up in that author regularly but not in things you have read in the past.Like everyone else in the thread said Greek is more tedious than truly hard. If you can grit your teeth through the first few months of memorization and drilling your Greek will only get better and better over time.

There&#039;s no point in learning Latin or Greek desu, everything of value has been translated into English.

Favorite book covers thread.This is one of my favorites, also a pretty solid edition.

The letters about the censorship are interesting too. I own the edition in the OP along with the old Penguin edition with the water colour portrait of Joyce on the back just because it&#039;s a nice edition.

holy fuck this is real
Tell that to anyone you want except me.
This sounds like a line from a Steven Seagall movie

What do you think of this one? I think i&#039;ll get this because i can&#039;t find the one you posted.
Nothing will ever surpass this
Thats the one I had, the one I posted I saw in a shop several days ago and considered rebuying it
I have this edition. The binding is so fucking bad. I feel like i could crumple it up into a ball.

What are your thoughts on Dreams of Amputation by Gary J. Shipley, sir?
The book was okay according to GoodReads reviews so we&#039;ve decided to give you another go. Do something a bit more flashy, more appealing to large audiences. I mean, you only got 49 ratings on GoodReads after all
But have you actually read it or have you just judged it by its reviews and ratings?

You can&#039;t tell... but they&#039;re actually squatting.

Finnish version of The Lord of the Rings.
This looks like one of those utter garbage Barnes and Noble collectibles.
That&#039;s exactly what it is
Wouldn&#039;t that just be the Kalevala then?
Not really. The Lord of the Rings certainly is influenced by Kalevala but the story is completely different. You also can&#039;t sing The Lord of the Rings.
Anyone else read this book? I thought it was cheesy at first but the way the characters were fleshed out and the way scenes happened made me really enjoy it. What did you think of this book?
But you&#039;re making a good thread by lit standards, so keep up the posting.
Characters are often presented by DeLillo in that way. They&#039;re usually academics with really good diction, so the dialogues are a little cheesy at first. Luckily, all that is redeemed.
and thank you for the compliment.
Did Bill fuck the &quot;fair youth&quot;?
If he was homosexual, probably. Older homos dont like to fuck men their age, homosexuality is a mental illness.
Why didn&#039;t he write any homo plays?
he had little boys dress up as young girls
Probably helped them practice their &quot;kissy scenes&quot;
How do you call this type of bookrest?I&#039;ve only seen it in old references. It seems appropriate for the good condition of the books.

I&#039;m writing a novel - which one of these does the job folks?
They&#039;re all fine assuming you&#039;re going for airport-core.
Stick with Andy. The rest probably the third cover.
Third one would be most likely to catch my eye if on a shelf.
i like the last but make you&#039;re name Andy if you&#039;re comfortable with it, initials are a bit pretentious imo.
Don&#039;t use &quot;a gripping psychological drama&quot;, that&#039;s generic as fuck. Try something like &quot;a consuming psychological drama&quot;, &quot;an oppressing psychological drama&quot;, &quot;an absorbing psychological drama&quot;.
Don&#039;t do this.
(See: S.J. Watson)
(Yes, I know, HP... How patrician of me.)
Third cover but get a better tagline. Maybe change the font of the title to be more commanding/interesting.I agree with this anon.
No. 3 has the best cover art, and I feel the best title too, but remove the tagline.
Third one. The eye is a powerful thing, and that framing is great. The other two give me nothing.
I used to be an absolute bookworm when I was younger but then PC games happened. Now, I want to get back into cultivating a reading habit, albeit in baby steps. I made it a goal for myself to read ten books in half a year without double-ticking (don&#039;t tick a classic fantasy novel under both categories). I also already decided on the kinds - four novels (2 fantasy, 2 non-fantasy), one self-improvement book, two classics, one play/epic, one (auto) biography and one non-fiction book. By non-fiction I mean stuff like, IDC, something about mechanics or learning a language or whatever). Now, my problem is that I can&#039;t decide which ones to read and/or where to start.Thanks in advance!

As for reading on the shitter, I take that time to check my mails and social media.
As a human being who has worked a 60 hour a week job for college whilst being married and having a kid and also having gone to university, i declare you full of shit

Why the fuck are there so many threads like &quot;oh duh how do I read&quot; every fucking day here? It must be because you people are actually stupid posers who want to look smart to the other kids at school. There&#039;s no secret about how to be &quot;a reader,&quot; just FUCKING READ THE BOOKS. How stupid are you?? If you don&#039;t automatically enjoy reading good books you&#039;re a fucking idiot and you shouldn&#039;t pretend you&#039;re not. Duhh durr I have to read ten books in half a year blah blah.. WHY?? Just fucking read the books you dickhead. It&#039;s not a contest. Nobody gives a shit about you.
Im in a somewhat similar situation like OP in that i want to start reading habitually daily,for me it&#039;s because i see that i do nothing with my time and i want to fill it in somehow,and i feel less guilty about filling that time with books
I fucking hate these parts desu
Is the idea of meme, as Dawkins proposed not a contradictory statement, just like relativism is.This seems to be the same kind of argument, am I wrong?
Yes, you are wrong. The first example is a paradox, but there is no self contradiction in the second. The key word is &#039;regarded&#039; that you used in the second example. The idea of a meme has nothing to do with relativism.
Not every proposition is regarded as true. Next.
It&#039;s remarkable how much a single word can convey.
Isnt the idea of a meme that it&#039;s value/truth/power is relative to the context it is embedded in?
day 1 pomo senpai
the only reason that this &quot;meme&quot; idea is used/surviving at the moment, is because it fits with our current context where darwinian science is prevailing.
The first one isnt a paradox because claiming it is a paradox is part of absolutism?
I think this better formulated
Who is the greatest philosopher of our times, and what is their best work?
I think that the greatest philosopher for the good life is Marcus Aurelius. For the truth it&#039;s very hard to say because nobody contributed more than a few percents to what we know about reality today in light of philosophy. The most important historically is maybe Plato or Kant.
Hans Hermman Hoppe Democracy the God that failed
shit fuck. Im an idiot. I meant to say current times. &quot;our times&quot; is too broad. I&#039;m looking more for recent phils.
Benedict XVI desu senpai
That guy is a mess. Terrible actor and looks like an alien. very sad.
Unironically this.
Hoppe is human trash.
Aristotle is a safe choice.
1) Which one scares you more?It really is no context for me. Orwell was a fool to think dictatorship would ever grip the entire West. He fundamentally misunderstood the individualistic liberalism that defined the Allied nations - Britain, the US, France. Huxley was much shrewder. He knew that the best way to control them isn&#039;t to try and keep them down, where they will ALWAYS fight back. The best way to control them is to distract them with hedonism so they don&#039;t even notice, or care, that they are kept down at all.
I bet this will get one tenth of the replies of some stupid frogpost.
You understand only the surface details of 1984. It is actually much closer to describing the modern methods of nation states. Corporate fascism is what Orwell was trying to expose. Fake news, 2 minute Hate, surveillance by media to compartmentalize thought all described by Orwell.

if you want (Yous)s post a picture of a philosopher, copy his main idea, dumb it down and greentext it.

This board deals primarily with Post Modernism, but what is it? Disillusionment with the West? With Secularization? With the Modern ideal of Western life? What?
Modernism is a cultural reaction to the industrialization of the late 18th and 19th century, and although it is reflected in literature and art, it began as a cultural change in the consensus of thought.A few works to exemplify this would be: Pale Fire, V, Slaughterhouse-Five, The Public Burning, How German Is It, White Noise, Et Tu Babe.
Postmodernism is a rejection of all metanarratives, a move beyond relationality, sameness, predication, &quot;isness&quot;, materialism, idealism, and beyond epistemology - beyond knowing altogether Very few can actually follow through with the basic mission, most are just posers still stuck in modernity
Read Jameson&#039;s &#039;Postmodernism, or, the cultural logic of late capitalism&#039;
Why can they be an embrace to a cultural movement? or can that be considered a reaction as well?
There&#039;s no such thing. Movements are a gross over simplification, where the life work of a countless geniuses are boiled into aphorisms. We&#039;ve already begun to stagnate. DFW was our swan song, think about that. What else to we have? A whiny, rambling Norwegian that writes about his shitty childhood in epics? or that depressed, anemic Frenchman?
Postmodernism is a reaction to everything. Its mostly for alienated psueds who can&#039;t make their own values and so resort to deconstructing and satirizing them.In their desire for rebellion and newness they become boring and samey themselves.
This. Global capitalism has killed art. At this point you should focus more on political disruptions than art, if this continues the human race will be reduced to inhuman slaves to an ever-expanding technological-capitalist system. There will eventually be no room for true art. This is the disillusionment of the postmodernists.
What profound fucking literary break through is someone whose spent half their life on a goddamn college campus gonna make? This guy had a fucking semester, a goddamn teacher at 27. What were Hemingway, Melville, Kerouac, or Wilde doing when they were twenty seven?
On the subject of gross over-simplifications...
You cannot tell me there isn&#039;t something lost when this creative act is removed from the individual and placed under the power-structured class rooms of a university. Shouldn&#039;t that at least be a concern? Why isn&#039;t anyone talking about it?
whatever goddamn story you wanna write, if that type of book can be sold in Barnes and Noble, than an advisor will tell you there are classes that will teach you how to write it.
we have Krasznahorkai
I didn&#039;t know people could only publish one thing, that being their thesis.
And artists are sensitive. I can see how classes over different techniques and explorations of different styles can be useful. But submitting something they wrote (especially during that critical stage where style is developed) under that influence their teacher hold over whether they pass or not, what grade they get in the class, what their gpa looks like, or what jobs or graduate programs they get into after is not a system that will incubate anything remarkable, because anything in the making of being remarkable will be seen as different and poorly done, and therefore discouraged.
postmodern philosophy has a &quot;pragmatic&quot; approach to everything. theres no objective truth, reality requires a subject that interprets it, theres no facts, just interpretations. These interpretation determine the way we act and our beliefs,therefore if the world is fucked we can just change them and change reality with it. It seeks liberty from evil institutions, like churches, capitalism, science, etc. The ugly incomprehensible language they use is also a part of it since language is a limitationfor liberty too or something idk
-a lot of sex for women
Once writers quit imitating, they develop a style, usually without realizing it. And they write and revise and read out loud and put space between themselves to look at it clearly. From this they learn their strengths and weaknesses, and how they can improve without changing. The idea of creative writing being taught doesn&#039;t let the student learn this. This role is filled by the teacher. Who see what THEY consider mistakes, things to do differently. The writer loses faith in his own judgement, relies too much on others, and adapts to conform to the &quot;CORRECT&quot; way to write.
How&#039;s it feel being fucking stupid?
Also what makes Ulysses Modern and not Post Modern? because it was written in 1922 and not in 1950?
foucault wanted to reject the dominant language use by making new absurd ones, inspired by surrealism, i have no idea if ulysses has anything to do with this tho.
How is the MFA different from what the rest of academia seems to be building to, which is everyone sucking eachother&#039;s dicks ?
Gaddis was ahead of his time, but i don&#039;t consider him the first Post Modernist Author. Nathaniel West covered the same general themes 22 years earlier with about 800 fewer pages.
wow ur so smart
Give me an example of postmodernism that goes beyond materialism.
Not everyone will put up with that shit, but many do. All because today&#039;s educational institutions have so much power over who gets published.
when exactly did literature degenerate into a weird masturbatory simulacrum of literature? how did we end up like this? It&#039;s a huge scam in which the con artists scam themselves.
I&#039;ve read Infinite Jest and My Struggle Vol 1+2 and Knausgaard is far superior to DFW. DFW wanted to write sincerely, Knausgaard fucking did it.
thank you for this, it is both comforting and inspirational
A lie.
We&#039;ve also become more dependent as we spend longer in school. With every Masters or PHD degree comes a person in their mid to late twenties who doesn&#039;t know what it truly means to take direction of their own life. They don&#039;t give those degrees to risk-takers. What this does to the certain narcissism/bravery that has to be had to attempt something innovating in something like writing can only be speculated on. You know no one with a degree will even consider this. But, looking at the scarcity of exciting, new ideas the last 25 years of MFA graduates has brought us, i don&#039;t think it does anything good.
Decentralization of subjectivity combined with collapse of national identity.

Why hasn&#039;t this been at least discussed?
Think about that. Most of Alchemy dealt with finding a method to make gold from different substances. It was the purpose of Alchemy. By saying this, he implies there is something to be attained beyond. What is that? The process of Alchemy itself; the belief in a magic within all things, between God and Earth, perfection. Not god or anything supernatural, but the system underlying alchemy, providing a framework to build his meaning upon. He turns away from the physical and moves inward, integrating himself with himself.
What has significantly challenged the institutional concept of the literary tradition in the last 25 years? Because i can&#039;t think of anything.
Why Gaddis was such a big qt?
All i see is regurgitation. I doubt you fully grasp everything you just said.
I like how you left enough space for a specific book by a specific someone
and i doubt you haven&#039;t sucked your dads dick, that doesn&#039;t make it true.
Capitalism is the best thing to happen to the human race so far. If art is left behind b/c of it so be it, there&#039;s enough great art to be consumed for infinity. If anything a new art is being realized through technology, seeing how far it can go for its own sake. The ironic part about you people complaining about an element missing from modern life is purely motivated by a demand to consume in itself. Always people wanting to be told about themselves by someone else, this is all that this thread proves.

Easier to talk about the post-modern NOVEL - any &#039;ism is going to be a broad Church.This is coming from a lay reader obvs, an academic would be able to tell you lots more about how post modern novels are self referential and distrustful of narrative etc
so what type of novels would guys like to see get released nowadays? Would you prefer something pynchonian, something surreal, some derivative of realism? I know this is a bad question in a lot of ways but I couldn&#039;t imagine what kind of novel I&#039;d buy of a contemporary writer, as in like not DeLillo or McCarthy, etc. I think I&#039;d really enjoy someone like a Vollmann. Experienced, well traveled, been through some shit, but well read and book smart too. There&#039;s gotta be someone out there who no one knows of sitting on a classic... Probably that guy Evan Dara
i only buy genre fiction page turners. Too many unread classics to waste time on contemporary shite about the immigrant experience or whatever the fuck type of books win literary prizes

You come off as a fedora

pretty you&#039;re critique i oversimplifying the study of literature and art. professors of these things understand that aphorisms and quotes only offer helpful snapshots into a large trends of thought, which exist quite undeniably
But scratch the surface, and you see it is nothing more than pathetic rantings.
WHY DID HE KILL HIMSELF?
wtf he&#039;s dead?
holy shit that drawing is bad
Because he saw the gas bill.
Either as a career move to make him seem more like a Kurt Cobain figure or because he saw his predictions coming true.
neurotic depression, he already tried to kill himself before dropping out of Harvard
To get to the other side
Chronic lack of talent

Sempai Pynchon didn&#039;t notice him.
Another one for the collection.
thanks i drew it
His depression was so bad he couldn&#039;t even think. Would you keep living if you were in that situation?
He was taking pills to remove that disability. I think the right question OP was trying to ask is why did he decide to stop with the pills.
I heard somewhere that he felt like he couldn&#039;t finish his last book with his medication
more like why didn&#039;t he kill himself sooner
correct
this
perfect end to the novel infinite jest. With him dying the jest truly becomes infinite
gee I really do wonder why did he Jews to stop with the pills
Anyway, have a (You) here.

 I only mean you well.
The fuck is wrong with your brain.
Huh, I guess xe was right.
nothing more pleb than only reading the classics.
Your shill technique needs a lot of refining. Think of the frog in the pot.Dedicated threads with antagonistic OPs will only drive people away.
oh I&#039;m not trying to shill that specific book, but newer books / not the classics in general.
If he had just written the damn book and not tried to format it like he was some avant-garde asshole it would have been better.
I think it&#039;s fine. just read it, don&#039;t be a faggot about it.
i did, dont be a faggot about shilling a book that is both unnecessarily long and obtuse
I find your response both shallow and pedantic
I find your slavish dedication to defending a book that is edited in such a way as to cover-up an inability to compose readable and compelling prose self-delusional and naive.
lol you&#039;re a funny guy. that&#039;s good. I don&#039;t know what you&#039;re talking about.
Kill yourself
Why does he make all those line-breaks and weird syntax. I&#039;m not the guy above but I&#039;m wondering this too, those few pages read very awkwardly
You need to work on your technique
I&#039;m sure he&#039;s using them as a means to communicate vocal tone or his perception of events as they play out in his head, but it just comes off as false complexity.
if you just keep reading it find it flows really well.
Are this guys&#039; bricks actually worth reading?

This is what happens to some dodgy ebooks I download.

Personally I find the whole modernism/post-modernism divide to be flimsy and empty of interpretive value but thats a separate story
Stupid bullshit for tryhard faggots.
If you arent tryharding you are a loser desu.
In the electric age, the centre achieved instantaneous communication with its periphery, which accelerated all the points along those lines of communication and dissolved the centre-periphery relationship, achieving a state where all points are equidistant from each other.
I didn&#039;t really understand it ro be honest. Been a while since I read it, but I remember one of their main points being an &#039;oscillation between irony and sincerity&#039; (parapphrasing). Do they really belive postmodenism was entirely ironic? I&#039;ve read my way through a decent chunk of postmodern (fiction and non), and there is no way any of them weren&#039;t already switching between the two.On a side note, anyone reas that essay about what comes next by some professor in 2006, and he talked about the participation midel of reality tv. Pretty interesting, wrong though. I&#039;ll see if i can find it later

postmodernism is going to be with us for much longer. critics pronouncing its death to this or that new tendency simply lack the dialectical imagination proper to criticism. what seems like the &quot;end&quot; of postmodernism, namely its absorption into popular consciousness through its appropriation by mass media, is simply its apotheosis, the blossoming of its highest form. meta-theatrical commercials that undermine their own status as commodity are the telos of Barthes&#039; Lost in the Funhouse.
astute observation

today i learned some new words
glad i could help
I think that we are probably living in a &quot;meta-modern&quot; world but I also think these fellows are fucking faggots.
I suggest you stop worrying about these labels and do something worthwhile.
lol that&#039;s not post-modernism. Post-modernism is treating seriously the mental illness that comes from the self-obsession and nihilism of being a pylon.
I hate how DFW popularized this idea that postmodernism is just irony, and how we need to bring sincerity and sentimentality back. Honestly, Gravity&#039;s Rainbow was probably just as sentimental as Bleak House, and Bleak House had it&#039;s fair share of cynical irony. The two usually exist in tangent, unless DFW had been reading really lame postmodernist stuff.
As far as I know, DFW was perfectly aware of Pynchon&#039;s work, also the comments about irony in pomo are commonly taken out of context and he didn&#039;t really meant it as to define the postmodern art/fiction, he attacked irony when speaking about the postmodern state of consciousness and how it defends itself through the infinite loop of irony.
I meant moreso like it frustrates me how people take it out of context yknow?
The fuck? modernism (or rather the more easily recognisable form of high modernism) didn&#039;t come about until after the end of the 19th century, and is recognisable as a bona-fide &#039;event&#039; or moment of crisis, usually coinciding with the first world war. Pomo, on the other hand, was a development in fiction which came about during the 1960s as people were becoming disillusioned by the grand metanarratives of enlightenment and progress espoused by modernist thinkers. You&#039;re right in your general distinctions between the two but I don&#039;t see how you can be so wrong about their points of origin
The Dada movement appears to me to be distinctly post-modern
I have no comment about &#039;metamodernism&#039;, it sounds even more fake.

To be fair, no one reads any more. So the only way it could make a splash is in a literary community.
ps you can tell it&#039;s dead when French philosophers start writing about the re-emergence of history in art, lol. I guess 1966 isn&#039;t the new 2016.
modernism started with Baudelaire and ended with ww1

What comes after atemporality?
What&#039;s the problem?
What did you mean by this?
I bet they&#039;re talking about a green planet, the benefits of diversity and Spinoza as a guiding light in all that, right?
the problem with the metamodern thesis is that it&#039;s not clear how the &quot;return to modernist tendencies&quot; is any different from postmodernist pastiche/parody and reification. i would say that metamodern is simply the name for the final pastiche of postmodernism, which is the pastiche of the modern itself. the problem is that at that point, there will be a moment where the difference—between the postmodern &quot;essence&quot; and what will by then be the metamodern &quot;appearance&quot;—will be totally indistinguishable, like a kind of philoso-critical poe&#039;s law.
a little criticism would do you good. you&#039;d know that the self-conscious creation of &quot;movements&quot; by the artists involved was a modernist flash in the pan. you think Goethe was self-consciously aspiring to Romanticism? au contraire: he had an ideal that critics called romanticism.
It will be more apparent in other mediums, literature is kind of a clusterfuck when it comes to this sort of thing
This might actually be it. A lot of the Senior thesis film projects in my class are working with a vague/anachronistic aesthetic regarding when they&#039;re set. Maybe it&#039;s a sign of what&#039;s to come.
i agree with you that lit is a wreck, but i believe we should take this as a sign that it&#039;s always been bunk. your concept of the postmodern seems apt, but i think it is lacking, insofar as you think the metamodern is possible as you&#039;ve described it: postmodernism will not have been realized as such until the art object is apparently new: at this point it&#039;s appropriation of the modern will be complete, total, and if we aren&#039;t careful our narratizing tendency, which resists postmodernity&#039;s infectious gravity, will be destabilized and sucked up along with everything else. thus if the concept is to be useful at all, the metamodern should be left open as a utopian ideal that reality could never quite manage, an empty seat left open for the totally new, the anti-Gesamtkuntswerk whose body has no original matter, a theory to which practice should tend but which it knows it can never grasp—call metamodernism the death drive of the postmodern, its inherent, virtual difference with itself: the euphoric nihilism of the absolute negation, for it must be absolute, given the totality postmodernism has so obviously become.
What building is that in the background

Metamodern visual arts faggot nodding on opiates sent from /pol/ via Google Alerts.Fuck i&#039;m high. But consensus truth.
Please fuck off with your shilling
I&#039;m probably going to try and find a way to apply a philosophy similar to this to my films.
too simplistic. there is a difference between rejection and historically determined unavailability. the commitment to the new, the communal, the revolutionary, that animated the modernists, is no longer thinkable as such in the postmodern, and when it appears that we have grasped it, it is hypostasized as an object of contemplation beyond all actual creative power. metamodernism is simply the name for the moment when postmodern nihilism doubles back on itself, and the vacuous simulation of the values of yesteryear finally grabs hold of the ethos of creation of the modern itself.
any luck finding it?

Kind of like a William S Burroughs book with the unrelated little pieces of text and longer ones. Then there&#039;s a lot of crazy illustrations and the text is formatted all different ways, a lot of times making fun of advertisements or magazine pieces by taking the visual design style of that but with shocking words or images. There&#039;s also a choose your own adventure novel that&#039;s interspersed between all the other content.

hey guys does anyone have a torrent for this yet? asking cuz i love MDE and really want to read this
Go back to &gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/ you mouth breathing retard

Dude it&#039;s just supposed to be satire. Stop taking it so god damn seriously. I think Sam and his antics are hilarious.
SAM HYDE IS REDDIT
Fuck off and never come back.
Eric Andre is funnier.
You&#039;re projecting.

Like a cool kid in highschool who hangs out with the bullies
I got the same impression tho. Isn&#039;t the guy literally a reddit moderator?
Dude, it&#039;s okay. We know you&#039;re projecting. It&#039;s clear that something Sam Hyde said in a funny video supposed to make you laugh really touched a nerve for you. You can stop now.

He&#039;s the moderator of his secluded community on reddit, yes, but he and most of the members frequently state their disdain for the vast majority of leddit and rightly so. Your argument that Sam Hyde &quot;is&quot; reddit is completely invalid.
Is that notion too much for you to process or something? This pretty much confirms that you&#039;re a mouth breathing reddit tier retard.
Did you pick up on that subtle ironic humor there? Bet you didn&#039;t fagot
Dude I&#039;m feeling pretty embarrassed for you, I think it&#039;s time to stop.
You have described someone who is very reddit right there.
Just repeat what I have already refuted. Alright, man.
You are a very funny poster anon.
That&#039;s literally rebbit. Everyone there thinks they&#039;re the real rebbit.
Hey man, thanks for defending your buddy Sam Hyde. I&#039;m sure your best friend really appreciates a cool guy like you defending him from &quot;mouth&quot; &quot;breathers&quot;
ITT: Mouth breathing redditors getting butthurt over Sam Hyde&#039;s satire

Can you like outline how you think you refuted Sam Hyde being reddit by saying he&#039;s reddit? That he doesn&#039;t like it because of a misplaced sense of superiority is even more reddit tbqh.
Wow, what a convincing argument you&#039;re laying out right there.
Are you claiming a misplaced sense of superiority over reddit?! :O You must be reddit then!!!
Are these guys the most recent iteration of those new-Atheists?
Are you saying that reddit is better than here bucko?
But instead, you just get the Sam Hyde ADL coming along to silence all criticism and mumble some shit about &quot;lol u mad&quot; or &quot;it&#039;s post-ironic, you don&#039;t get it&quot; or &quot;the tranny lied&quot;. Sad!
OK let&#039;s analyze Mr.Hyde&#039;s humor for real here:Once that happens we will truly have ascended into at least 3 levels of irony
I hate Sam Hyde now
Nobody&#039;s saying you should hate him, just that he&#039;s a talentless hack. Lots of people in showbiz are talentless hacks tho.
Woaahhh you&#039;re sooo above it all aren&#039;t you?? ;^)

Sam Hyde is White culture now? And here I thought he was a third rate Andy Kaufman ripoff that happened upon an extremist base and was too dumb to dump them before it ruined his career.
ya white people are lame af that&#039;s why they have sam
I dislike how this has devolved into a MDE hate thread
MDE fans don&#039;t read. This was the only possible outcome.
Don&#039;t steal, you fucking cunts.
Seriously, if you&#039;re going to come to 4chan you need to be able to deal with the fact that other people might not like the thing you like.
being this low iq
Why is there a thread about a book that apparently no one has read or purchased yet? Wait a couple weeks and then post about your right-wing comedians extraordinaire. That way people (possibly) won&#039;t feel compelled to tell you to fuck off, and the shills can jerk each other off in peace instead of playing defense.
Not a shill, just genuinely interested in their book
Lol. It&#039;s so obvious when people who are totally new to MDE are posting about them. The alt-right? Pretty irrelevant to what MDE is trying to do. I suggest you watch some more of their stuff or you will continue to look retarded
, moron.
, moron. It&#039;s embarrassing watching you try to talk about something you have no grasp of.
Anyone got the code for a free e-book?
You can also pick up his book at Ross

Is his shtick just being the annoying right-wing bigot he is?
Im a MDE fan and I read all the time you hateful bigot! I probably have better taste than you too
Imaging a non-memeing Trump supporter reading Pynchon. Literally mind boggling.
Is Sam Hyde actually an edgy alt-right faggot (outside of his work)?
Check his Twitter feed. By the looks of it, he is. Pizzagate and all.
Pynchon is one of my favorite authors lol
Or have you deluded yourself into thinking Pynchon somehow reflects your ideology?
And Evola, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Pirsig, Deepak Chopra, Gene Wolf, Palahniuk and R.A. Lafferty are other favorites of mine (a self proclaimed &quot;MDE fan&quot;)
No you bafoon, I respect his work and can enjoy a work of art and the story itself without self identifying with the ideology behind it, same with MDE lol stop projecting dude
has that guy ever said anything worth hearing?
I also enjoy Franz Kafka, Aldous Huxley, Dr. David Duke, George Orwell, Stephen King, John Howard Griffin, and even fucking Ayn Rand so fucking sue me you elitist sperg. Stop caring what other people enjoy
Most contemporary literature is shit, and most of the best writers have historically been far-right. Name a lefty writer who is within miles of Dostoevsky or Celine. You can&#039;t.
Have you even read through I single Pynchon book and understood it? Which do you think your favorite is and why?
I think you have to go back.
Pynchon is a writer of the modern era and has a definite and pronounced political dimension to his work.
What you mean I slipped palahniuk in at the end hoping no one will notice? Why wouldn&#039;t I have wanted you to notice is he not hip enough lol? Those are my favorite authors it&#039;s cool if you think their &quot;memes&quot; or whatever that means... Idk what it is your so mad about desu you Must be what I call a plebeian (lol)
This is just patently false. Neither Joyce nor Proust, both of whom are leagues above Celine and and Dostoevsky, could be considered far-right writers. And let&#039;s not forget about Tolstoy the anarchist, or Wilde the socialist. You don&#039;t seem to have any idea what you&#039;re talking about.
Lol. Dostoevsky was a far-right religious fanatic ultraconservative monarchist, and Celine was a literal Nazi. There&#039;s nothing ambiguous here.
Palahniuk is as close as you can get to watching television while reading. It&#039;s full of edgy meaningless allusions to concepts that he never really grapples with.
Translation: the artists who were alive when far-right views were socially acceptable don&#039;t count. Only the artists who were alive when only far-left views were socially acceptable count.

That does not make him &quot;far-right&quot; in the modern sense, you fucking ingrate.
Yeah I like Pynchon, I like gravitys rainbow cause of how dense and how deeply poignant his prose is. I love how his wide array of characters are beautifully woven into the complex narrative. Truly ahead of his time and ambitious
Sam actually believes in the pizzagate shit?
Is this the most cancerous thread on /lit/? 
Get a fucking grip, reading isn&#039;t about pretending that Plato would have voted for Donald Trump based on your twelve grade half reading of The Republic.
We&#039;ve been having daily 200+ post Sam Hyde threads recently and I don&#039;t understand why
Oh, let me guess. You think I&#039;m being paranoid.
This is such a dumb fucking straw man, and it&#039;s obvious now that you&#039;re a middle brow John Oliver viewer who is incapable of conceiving of any sort of political beliefs outside of the context of modern American politics. Nobody is saying Homer was a Ron Paul Republican and would have been pro-GamerGate, you fucking hair-splitting goalpost-moving dunce. The terms &quot;right&quot; and &quot;left&quot; have coherent meaning outside of the US two-party system, and yes, the xenophobic antisemitic Christfag monarchist who thought the Pope was the Anti-Christ was far-right by any definition, in any time.
Get a grip bro your losing it
You idiots are blind fucking populists being led by an ingrate. He&#039;s going to be your and this country&#039;s Oliver Cromwell, mark my fucking words.
It&#039;s called marketing, you tool!
I&#039;ve wasted enough time talking here. I&#039;ll be going back to reading now. I want to finish the Invention of Morel tonight and you aren&#039;t going to stop me.
You know that people still hold Dostoevsky&#039;s views today, and they&#039;re considered far-right, don&#039;t you? &quot;Far-right&quot; doesn&#039;t mean member of the Republican Party. How can you be this myopic? No one is saying that he&#039;s an American-style Republican, which would be silly, but he is objectively far-right. Get over it.
Here&#039;s a major difference: Cromwell&#039;s rise to power was undemocratic and illegal under the government of the time.
Damn, now I need to add monarchists to my ropelist.
im a monarchist and think ur retarded
Your post is a complete nonsequitor, and assuming you are a monarchist, none of your previous posts make any sense. You literally started out by saying you couldn&#039;t imagine any conservatives tolerating any contemporary literature. You&#039;re either pic related or legit mentally ill.

lol. No one cares what you &quot;are.&quot; Or what historical genius you&#039;re closest &quot;to.&quot; You&#039;re a fucking retard dude
make people feel bad by beating them in arguments and walking away
I&#039;m not looking to make anyone feel bad
I have it but I&#039;m not gonna share it bc Sam told me not too. It&#039;s $14 you homo.
Neato
HE &#039;BOUT TO DO IT
Stop bumping this shit thread with facile jabs about dissonant politics and literary dick-measuring you stupid pedantic fucks
Yeah! Stop bumping this maladroit post with incandescent protuberances or I&#039;ll blithely correlate your asymptotes!
dude youre an intellectual we get it
thanks for giving us an unfunny translation of the post directly above yours
im sorry
I&#039;m guessing the emails are real, it&#039;s just the picture that&#039;s replaced.
He apparently actively deletes those posts from Reddit. It looks legit to me. I also like to imagine the busty dude with a Barry White voice.
anyone have mega link or torrent yet

no u
Nice trips btw.
has someone fuckin uploaded it yet
H-h-how does it feel to touch a women?
Pretty good. They&#039;re very soft.
like touching a man but without the interesting conversations and mutual anal sex
think you should light a copy on fire and shove it up your gay nigger faggot ass, you gay nigger faggot ass.
You can smell the tism
meanwhile the left and even liberalism has a billion more interesting writers in its history. to be frank, this is the nature of the left -- it is intellectual, it is theoretical. with the exception of fascism and some traditionalist stuff, the right (and almost never the modern right) has never cared at all about articulating themselves.
It&#039;s supposed to be satire, but of what? They just say /pol/ shit and then hide behind 200 layers of irony but that&#039;s just it? A sweaty, balding autist with pube beards being /pol/ post-ironically? Like, every print from this book I&#039;ve seen is some shit strawman against le librul cucks, Jesus. That anon who creates autistic personas like memoir-kun is leagues ahead of MDE as a comedian.
ftfy
Having now seen the video where he spends his adult swim money on autistic shit, and then the Tim Heidecker thing, I&#039;m enjoying the schadenfreud tbqh
damn
maybe if you are retarded
Junger was not a monarchist, he had no sentimentality towards the Kaiser. I suggest you read up on the Conservative Revolutionary Movement

Can&#039;t really blame him considering how shit the last Kaiser was.
Is Sam the post-modern reincarnation of Yasuda Yojūrō&#039;s Fascist aestete as expressed through Irony?
exactly. it&#039;s such misplaced, low brow satire with half decent adult swim style in your face, how high are you 1 AM animations and editing. there&#039;s way too many threads about a guy who in reality isnt that funny and all in all had a shadowed version of tim and eric, eric andre and xavier renegade angel&#039;s styles
where&#039;s the link not going to blow my bib ratio on sam hyde&#039;s book lol
The Tim and Eric style is a play on the legacy editing suites still being used from like the 80s and 90s, and the amateurish looking editing that that tied people in to. MDE seems to be very well funded and slick as far as materials, they just look similar because they&#039;ve taken the looking amateurish and shit thing and run with it. I also love that it&#039;s cancelled and the idiot&#039;s worrying about affording health insurance. Now that&#039;s comedy.
Christ almighty.

How did the extreme right went from Celine and Hamsun to this?
What did he mean by this?
hey Sam, nice to see you around, upload the book
Amazing Atheist has really let himself go
You don&#039;t see a difference?
A difference? He looks worse now than before is one surely.
Hey can someone please post a torrent/mega upload link if someone has a pdf of this? Haven&#039;t seen one yet and it looks like an interesting read.
Fucking seriously, I bought the damn physical copy and I&#039;m waiting on Sam to stop talking to Obama&#039;s brother and just email me the fucking pdf already.
No.
sent ;^)
Dear cyberninjas, bring us the book already.
I like you. I thought the set design and the non-MDE actors were the strongest parts of the show, aka stuff the MDE kiddos were not in direct control of. These guys were just youtube amateurs propped up by an adult swim production team. After hearing the interview with Tim, I feel like a third party professional in the performance industry would not be inclined to hire Sam because of his strange behavior. Sam seems hard to work with, and production teams will only suffer eccentricity when the director has a good track record.
For real, they made more money selling physical copies than they did making the adult swim show. Plus, Sam Hyde already said he doesn&#039;t mind the book being put up in a torrent. Why are you guys being dicks and not sharing?
No shit.
just read the front page of reddit for eight hours
Funny that the alt-right hates contemporary art because it is apparently only supposed to shock the viewer but when an &quot;alt-right&quot; show tries to shock the viewer it&#039;s one of the most important shows to ever air on TV.Thanks for your input, alt-right.
I like how communities tend to either be full slaanesh or inquisition

Holy shit, it&#039;s like being twelve on the internet in book form.
It&#039;s called a scam, Mom, and it&#039;s not a phase!
It&#039;s satire anyway.
What are they satirizing, though? Being twelve and thinking you&#039;re the shit?
lol still haven&#039;t got your book published yet?
I&#039;m sorry, but I&#039;m still not seeing how you are getting this vibe from a thank-yous page. If you mean the design style then yeah, that&#039;s just the general vibe they&#039;ve got going there for their satirical elements you&#039;d see if you actually gave it a go because a credits page isn&#039;t really supposed to make you laugh.

yes this board is largerly losers who could never get a book published prove me wrng
I didn&#039;t expect the super edgy, censored-for-his-views, alt-right-retweeting sketch comic to refer to his Reddit club as &quot;booger-eating Gods&quot;. How is that not funny?
Mega? Anyone?
just browse the front page of reddit for a few hours, the whole point is that this literary achievement is a physical edition of reddit
Like I&#039;m guessing you don&#039;t go to the frontpage of reddit very often... but like.... it&#039;s way more fuckin bad than I think even you realize
This book isnt funny at all but its fascinating as a portrait into the authors psychosis.
Seriously, this is awful.
The illustrations are pretty good though.
This is a rather good passage.
So it&#039;s like Heisman&#039;s suicide note, but dumber and try-hard. And unfunny. Gotcha.
Do you think Pynchon&#039;s books reflect his own ideology? He keeps writing anarcho-primitivist stuff while he lives in fucking Manhattan, the least primitivisitc place on the planet.
I can&#039;t tell if he&#039;s being serious
This is good shit. Makes me glad I preordered it.
Is anyone going to upload this somewhere?
Sam is a literal moderator of a reddit group that he started.
The tranny/trap that facefucked him is literally less reddit than him.

that was from KSTV not world peace. The joke was he wasted all the fan&#039;s kickstarter money on bikes and LPs.
Nah, it was world peace. It was all comics and shit too, not LPs gramps.
Your fucking retarted it was a joke he said &quot;I spent the KSTV money on the most expensive vinyls I could find&quot; and the bikes and stuff wasn&#039;t his, he was filming in a friends garage.
Nah, I&#039;m talking about world peace, he spent the money on like batman comics. What don&#039;t you understand about that? Now he can&#039;t afford health care.
What are you 14 year olds talking about today?
Sam Hyde is a true hero, acting like a turboretard and fucking up his own life for our amusement, it&#039;s all &#039;ironic&#039; of course
I wonder if he&#039;ll try to ironically kill himself in an attempt to ironically do a kurt cobain, and if anybody will care
Thank you mate.
Why is the PDF only 373 pages when the book is supposed to be over 750?

Your retarded
Are you serious?
I do NOT want an MDE fanboy RATing my computer because of this

Run it in a virtual machine.
He&#039;s the Stavrogin we need.
This book is just Mark Leyner with more racism
Holy fuck
This is just Sam whining about some guy having a girlfriend lmao
This was in one of his videos and actually made sense in context but it just seems like schizo rambling without context
about 50% of the book is just stuff from their videos
i agree
i like mark leyner
Why didn&#039;t anyone tell me buying used books was so addictive? There should be a warning as part of the sticky. It&#039;s like I&#039;m a kid again with pokemon cards or something. Anyone else really enjoy hunting for used books? It&#039;s become a problem. I will buy first edition copies of books I already own when I see them. I think I get more pleasure out of collecting than actually reading. I&#039;m an addict.
What do you mean &quot;again?&quot;
well I haven&#039;t collected anything really since I was a kid and that&#039;s what this is turning into. a collection of books.
But are you actually reading them anon?
yes but I will read maybe 2 books a month at best and purchase maybe 10-20 a month : $
Yep, it&#039;s a gentle madness. Welcome to the club. Cancel your credit cards.

when it chose to reply to bait again
Trust me, it&#039;s no bait. I just don&#039;t feel like it is relevent anymore. Only prose matters now.
Well, I shan&#039;t hear of it! Poetry (good poetry) is beautiful, and beauty is its own use.


Prose doesn&#039;t matter either now. Who reads novels?
Are these words supposed to rhyme?
Only if you pronounce it like &quot;a-geyn&quot; not &quot;a-gehn.&quot;


I unironically agree. Poetry is retarded because it draws attention to the language while a good writer should strive to draw the attention away from it, closer to the realm of ideas and imagery. Not to mention that poetry is outclassed completely by music and visual arts when it comes to aesthetic pleasure
Admit it, a system based on a priori ethical maxims founded on the categorical imperative is the only way to form a coherent system of ethics. Everything else is just meme teir.
you can&#039;t imagine my dismay when I found out through genealogy that I&#039;m part Anglo
Virtue ethics is and always has been superior
this is correct
Did the image intend to make that point?
How about them error theory?
Anybody got all the variables to this or know where I can find them?
silly frogposter
MacIntyre doesn&#039;t even understand Kant and his virtue ethics is just a rationalization of &quot;do as the Catholic church tells you&quot;. There&#039;s a reason it was thrown into the thrash during the Enlightenment.
And there is a reason that it was revived in the 50&#039;s and has exploded in academic support in the last 20 years.
Well, I certainly don&#039;t agree with Kant or the categorical imperative, but I do think that a moral system having it&#039;s roots in our cultural emotional history will be more worthwhile than one based on consequences.

How did glorious peoples like the germans and the celts decayed into dirty anglos? Inbreeding? Poor diet?
Yeah, if you&#039;re in the civil service...
Interestingly, McIntyre agreed with Aquinas heavily after Virtue Ethics.
#2: There is no reason to suppose that moral relativism is a bad thing, nor any reason to suppose that the alternative is preferable.
The Germans were one of the least sophisticated ethnic branches of the Indo-Europeans. I&#039;m surprised that even with the help of the Latins they were ever able to achieve anything.
Yep, I mean it&#039;s not like people ever thought there was anything like God to derive morality, or reason or utility. No one ever believed those things.
Not really.
I see you are taking the Putin approach. Tell such an outrageous obvious lie that people don&#039;t really know what to do next.
Thanks Zizek
Best answer so far. Relativism/consequentialism drop your duty ethics bullshit shitposter op
So.. your idea is that we should find something objectionable somewhere in that crude drawing?
I&#039;ve written a few short stories I want to publish. How do you get around self-publishing?
By having enough funds.After that translate each and every bit of &#039;anti-Soviet&#039; literature that hasn&#039;t been translated to my native tongue.
This, also typesetting systems like LaTeX, I typeset all my shit and put it online for free as PDF.
By the way, I&#039;ve released few short story collections and ten very, very dry academic history works through major publishers in my native country. So, I&#039;m not completely ignorant when it comes to writing either.
senpai
Where do I start with this man? Is there a handy flowchart anywhere?
Short stories.Then some novels: Confessions of a Crap Artist, Ubik, A Scanner Darkly.

nice
I would trade out Scanner Darkly for Flow My Tears and add VALIS. That book once made me find God for a bit while I was suffering from lack of sleep.

Name something good about this book protip, you can&#039;t
plot twist he is a phony owooowoowoahahahahah 10/10 10000/10000
Holden rapes his sister Phoebe being one good part, there are others too
comfy, entertaining, reminds you of the joys and pains of youth, unique style, moving, funny etc.
and probably the most accessible classic everpic related is my gf
Funny! Apt descriptions. Can remind you that you aren&#039;t so alone. Maybe.
and i just remembered that i bought her this book like a week after we started dating and its her favorite book now
I hate to break it go you but...
There is no reason this should be sold as a book, there is no begginning or end, its like a skit
Has introduced a lot of people to reading and is a rarely well-done take on adolescence.
Plot is for lames.
Incest
It&#039;s funny.
The part where he wants to become a monk even though he is not Catholic. Why don&#039;t people here like this book, he sounds like a /lit/ poster.
It reminds /lit/ how goddam phony they are. It really does.
People have an opinion on this book before they ever read it, if they even do read it. They want to hate it.It&#039;s so damn good holy fuck.
the part where his old teacher tries to get some boipussy when Holden is sleeping on the sofa made me fap
It&#039;s good because it catches the persona of the teenager becoming cynical in response to the shock of maturing
I&#039;m 25% done with and liking it so far. First book in English that I&#039;m reading and as the other anon said, it&#039;s very accessible.Also, I had an Ackley kind of friend and I could relate a lot to Holden&#039;s thinking about him. Fucking dude!
Just started. It ain&#039;t bad so far but i see nothing special. We&#039;ll see
But was he really trying to get some or was Holden overreacting?
the characters
his use of the expression &quot;shooting the shit&quot;
I used to love this book when I was 12.Now it just seems cringey.
the not existing flow of time while I read it
He was almost definitely over reacting. Holden has shown before that he jumps to conclusion quickly, especially when it comes to generalizing other people&#039;s personalities. He also expresses discomfort with being touched and homosexuals.
Great book about grief.
lol
If this piece of shit didn&#039;t exist I never would&#039;ve read Nine Stories, which is fantastic
Name something bad about this book protip, you can&#039;t

It&#039;s worth it because then you get to be one of like 10 people who can be proud enough to pretend like they understood a single thing the fucking autist was saying.
if you put the same effort into understanding the greeks as you would into hegel , you will have have learned much more

So like every other philosopher?
/lit/ is so absurdly easy to troll. The pompous retards replying to the &quot;redpiller&quot; are the reason this board was flooded and went to shit.

But you&#039;re too stupid to remember something like that, and you&#039;re too defensive to accept responsibility for your countless mistakes, so you&#039;ll go on shitting up the board like we never had this conversation, never learning anything, never besting anybody, at least you&#039;ve read classic literature and aren&#039;t a pseud, right? Wrong. I can tell just from that post you&#039;re a pseud. Don&#039;t dare reply to me again.
The whole point of reading classic literature and philosophy is to acquire cultural capital with which to dominate others intellectually and socially.
How do I acquire cultural capital with which to dominate others sexually?
become a meme author/director

this is why i come to /lit/
no
Masterful dodge

yeah, much more about fucking boys. hegel completed philosophy.
take the real redpill and read Unamuno&#039;s The Tragic Sense of Life
Is worth the effort worth the effort?
That was my experience with Hegel
It is dense as fuck. I liked Kant better.
You have to re-read,
I agree, but I don&#039;t think this always works for me, especially if I find it boring.
Why would you read it without hegels ladder?
It&#039;s fine, for Hegel I&#039;d suggest reading his lectures first.
Hegel is NRx as fuck stfu cuck
???
Which lectures exactly do you mean?
On the History of Philosophy and The Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences.

Hegel was as conservative as they come.
i like u

i should just kill myself.
I believe in you.
Please do.
Nice work. Keep it up.
don&#039;t do it my man
Hello friends,I would greatly appreciate it!
bump
first reminded me of &#039;no exit,&#039; kind of like some sort of existentialist stuff, then turned me around to auden...post wwii kind of feel and collectivization of the populous. interesting but i think you could flesh out the first couple of lines and make it a bit more clear where he is (got a little confused when he suddenly turned up at the census bureau)
Overall, I thought it was quaint. I&#039;m not sure what the story is really going for. This is quite possibly my failure, though, because I&#039;m not sure how much effort I was/am putting in to thinking about your story. I could say more, but I&#039;d think it be better if you told me your mindset while writing it. I see this as a success if you had an idea you thought was okay and took maybe an hour writing this just for fun. If you are trying to &quot;say&quot; something or have it be extra stylish, I don&#039;t really see any success here. Maybe my interpretation is too greatly effected by my thoughts on the normal curve. That curve is not &quot;found,&quot; it is forced by statisticians. Things do not fall along a normal distribution. Statisticians force them to just so their field doesn&#039;t fall apart. With this in mind, I&#039;m not sure if you&#039;re speaking as the character or commenting on the character and their beliefs. Either way it seems trite to me. So I don&#039;t really see a strong message or style, but I had no problem reading it. Overall it just seems really in one-eye-out-the-other.
How can they pronounce all the equations?&quot;since time immemorial&quot; made barf a bit too.
nah but it was a good story.
The idea is not particularly good but you you write some truly excellent dialogue. You know when to have them speak and when to show their actions, it is on point. The whole &#039;bell curve&#039; thing is not particularly strong though, see Perhaps you could consider writing a small act for a play instead?
But, I read the entire thing, and was intrigued, so you definitely did something right. Great pacing, interesting characterization, and fluid writing. You should keep writing.
fuck off
That being said, the recurring motif of eyes and being watched has some merit, but the story just comes on all too quick and doesn&#039;t really create a connection between the conversation and the motif.
You really should think your writing is good or what&#039;s the point in showing people
Making money
dropped

Thanks for the thoughts and comments guysIt was originally written for a short story competition with the theme of &quot;What if normal distribution had never been discovered&quot; or something. But now I&#039;m planning on submitting it into a maths literary journal.
But really I&#039;d say don&#039;t try to refine it anymore. It&#039;s a fine little thing and shows you&#039;re quite good at writing, go write some more things my man.
Hi /lit/ I&#039;m not sure if this is wear this post belongs but here I go. Is there a term to describe writing that uses comedy to brush off inconsistencies, absurd plot points, or problems in the story?
Postmodernist maybe
I guess its just bad comedy. I was thinking of useless comic reliefs ruining storytelling but realized that comedy can be problematic to a story in general. Star wars is a good example that everyone knows even though it is a movie. Jar Jar Binks is a terribly written character who&#039;s comedy act ruins the overall cohesiveness of the story. However, the new film also has problems balancing its comedy overall even though it didn&#039;t really have any comic relief characters. When Finn and Poe meet the writers use a step brothers &quot;DID WE JUST BECOME BEST FRIENDS&quot; comedy routine to gloss over the absurdity and plot convenience.
Trivializing and glossing over things is kind of a staple
?
thanks
napoleon was pretty much the typical /lit/ poster if you replace rousseau with nietzsche
come on reply to my thread pls
hmmmmm
dump em

Stirner is lame and reddit tier now

well spooked friendo
Fuck off with your shit thread
When did this board get a stick in its ass about Stirner? I remember some months ago when one of these threads were posted, it got a lot of replies and Stirner images.

Meme got old
Stirner is the wallpaper now.
the philosophy didn&#039;t hold up.

Stirner may have meme potential but Nietzsche has more staying power
Spookposting is only fun when some haunted motherfucker might as well be holding a seance with his &#039;argument&#039;In a vacuum, stirnerposting does not please me
This guy is correct.

this image show that this is how many people on the right understand his philosophy, they can&#039;t even comprehend that things like morality or truth are concepts that don&#039;t exist outside the mind and are rejected by Stirner so they caricature him as somebody that reject reality


fuck the retards at /pol/ for coming up with it
Its not even a meme, its what happens when someone who needs a picture to try dismiss every argument gets desperate
Hot dude authors.
Stop the Gaddis spam
I&#039;d rather people spam Gaddis than DFW.
The very best.
Camus is a hunk.And Kerouac is cheating.
Kafka is qt as hell
Hemingway. no homo maybe
Alpha AF
DFW is beautiful in the right light
Camus is the hottest philosopher
Camus looks like a toad. People only think he&#039;s handsome because of his contradistinction to Sartre.
How did he fuck so many bitches then? Charm?
How do you think Sartre got so many bitches?
I don&#039;t know why but in older society and especially in france it was perfectly normal for women to see old men or unattractive men as hot or date-able, fuckable etc.
dat post-ssri fatface tho
He had potential, bandana ruined him desu
Now we live in the twilight, soon to be suffocated by darkness
Goddamn man Camus, more like Chadmus, how can Sarte (aka Farte) even compete?
Sounds about right.
my husbando(s)
Can you even wrap your head around Mcelroy let alone read him?
does anybody have a pdf/epub of this?
Hey lit, help me out on this. My teacher mentioned a short story that she read a long time but could never find again. It was about a guy who wanted to be a priest; connect with God (idk, something like this) and went to live on a Count&#039;s mansion. The Count never eats, guy gets suspicious, Count turns out to be a vampire and been drinking the blood from Christ&#039;s wounds, guy gets restless thinking that the man is closer to God than him and asks the Count to transform him. Story ends with them both naked on a church, and as Count bites the dude two bats enter the place. Do anyone recognize this or something like it?
?
ok I actually smirked at this
Sounds like something von Kleist would write. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s him though.

Has /lit/ heard of Joy Williams? Do you like her?
So you haven&#039;t? Here&#039;s an extract from &#039;The Wedding&#039;, which is one of the first stories of her first book, &#039;Taking Care&#039;.&quot;Sam and Elizabeth met as people usually meet. Suddenly, there was a deceptive light in the darkness. A light that reminded the lonely blackly of the darkness. They met at the wedding dinner of the daughter of a mutual friend. Delicious food was served and many peculiar toasts were given. Sam liked Elizabeth&#039;s aura and she liked his too. They danced. Sam had quite a bit to drink. At one point, he thought he saw a red rabbit in the floarl centerpiece. It&#039;s true, it was Easter week, but he worried about this. They danced again. Sam danced Elizabeth out of the party and into the parking lot. Sam&#039;s car was nondescript and tidy except for a bag of melting groceries.&quot;
