name a more useless gadgetprotip: you can&#039;t
that doesnt look useless, some cases have their usb ports vertical while others have them horizontal
Your mum
It&#039;s not useless when the device you&#039;re trying to connect is fucking wide and blocks 2 ports. In those cases you can use this.
I use short cables like that when I need to plug a flash drive into the back of a case so I don&#039;t have to worry about it breaking off.
/thread
I&#039;m actually about to order two because the USB ports on my SBC are mounted vertically and with the peripherals plugged in sideways they don&#039;t fit in the case
usb micro type A.
One year later, when they released the FEZ Panda II, they added USB Host and said &quot;if you update the firmware and add a couple resistors between USB pins on a male to female adaptor, you can get USB host on the Panda I as well&quot;.. So I got one of those.

My dad hoards USB cables like that.

Epic meme, friend xD
this is an 18+ board. time for you to fuck off and come back in a couple of years when  you&#039;re of age.
That cable is useful for plugging in THICC USB drives.Smartphones.
Maybe you&#039;re the one who hasn&#039;t seen the real world
Jokes on you I&#039;m 37 years old.
Does everyone&#039;s parents die when they hit  18?
In some countries they&#039;d be long gone by then
no but you generally stop bringing them up all the time in conversations
You&#039;re supposed to murder your parents when you turn 18
It&#039;s not like he shoehorned it in. It was completely relevant to this thread
you bring them up when they&#039;re the one&#039;s using the supposedly useless tech.
I have a few 3ft ones of these. They are actually useful to bring another port to the front side of a case or extend a keyboard&#039;s cable a bit so it can reach your computer under your desk.

I use these when I boot from a live USB. It takes all the stress off the drive. Without them, the thumb drive gets destroyed anytime you bump it.
colleges won&#039;t let you use a smartphone on a test.
I have a TI graphic calculator. I think it was a wasted purchase, its capabilities are far beyond what I needed at school, but in university I had MATLAB to do everything the calculator could do, and in the real engineering world I don&#039;t need to do any maths.

This is good for use with some usb sticks on cars
Dont you remember the years of bulky USB devices?
I just can&#039;t stand what they did to the home button. Pressing it and feeling absolutely no feed back triggers me.

USB 3.0 causes interference with wireless mice\keyboards that run on the 2.4hz frequency. This dongle would be perfect to move it a couple inches away from the device.
Really?
I used one of these to hack my original Xbox and run Win 95 and Gentoo on it. Shit&#039;s far from useless.
No. He&#039;s a jackass. They run on 2.4ghz anyway, not 2.4hz.
whitepapers/327216.pdf
underrated
kek
They only found interference if the wireless mouse was more than 3 feet from the receiver. Moving the 3.0 dongle a few inches away wouldn&#039;t have any practical effect.
Has anyone ever seen this? For anything? Ever?
But it does, it moves the wireless receiver a few inches away from the device lowering interference from the port itself and increasing the signal response from the wireless accessories.
Firewire 800
Very useful, I was just shopping for a Firewire 800 HDD enclosures a few hours ago

useless outside apple world
It&#039;s actually a pretty good connector, sadly it&#039;s from Apple
Absolutely useful if you&#039;re trying to steal encryption keys from a Mac&#039;s RAM. Same for thunderbolt.

This. Target mode is nice at least.
i would never let a mac inside my home or worksplace

I want RMS out
It&#039;s a we&#039;ll sue your company to the brink of bankruptcy port
Nah, plenty of non-Macs had Firewire, it&#039;s just even more useful on Macs.
We have a mix of windows 10 and ubuntu pcs
Firewire 800 was never used outside apple world
32MB
How popular its use was doesn&#039;t determine the usefulness. Firewire 800 is very useful.
how come this isn&#039;t mentioned
useless things can be useful for a few people with special needs
As can useful things.
i bet that you wouldn&#039;t say that about paralell port
it&#039;s not useless, sometimes you cant fit a device if 2 usb ports are close together
512MB or 1GB actually
Because it still hasn&#039;t shipped. Apple can&#039;t get them to work yet.
And I wouldn&#039;t be wrong.

Russians and their associates steal MILLIONS, hundreds of millions even and nothing ever happens to them.
Is this the new dank meme thread?
That&#039;s only because Russian prisons are already overcrowded and the country is literally owned by the mob.
It just makes me mad that some people are making hundreds of millions of dollars. and they&#039;re not even providing a service or helping people, but just stealing.
Are you retarded? We can steal whoever we want because Russian government doesn&#039;t care about any attack if it happened outside Russia. Moreover if you part of some group cia  knows about you and will try to kidnap you if you are outside Russia
Anyways this just isn&#039;t fair. Why should I work an honest job when Ivan steals hundreds of millions of dollars?
Even in russia authors make no many. The leader of the group makes about 4kk$ a year. If you hide injects in code or working with word embedded files you make around 120k$ a year but these people do nothing useful. If something good happens to this country every one of them would be in prison. They just taking risk
How much do these people really make then. Is it better to just start a legit business?
What type of business you are talking about? They are not professionals. The guy that edits injects can&#039;t even code. I know him personally. I can&#039;t say anything positive about them. They are just retards who think that they are the smartest people on the planet and will never get caught.

First for X230
T460 or T460s?Worth waiting for T470/s or will they just get progressively worse?
Hi anons I asked you before but I have got one more question: I have only integrated graphics in my T420 so should I do anything special to get egpu working? (like downgrading BIOS, I use 1.48) and can you post your specs and some information about game (how they run or something like this)
ONE FUCKIN GJOB
I work as a computer technician for a small refurbishing company. We only work with business laptops and computers. I have a T430 for myself with a 250 GB SSD. Thing runs like a dream still.
You can still access M.2, single DIMM slot, mini PCIe and batteries if you remove the T460s back cover.
I bought this for 650$you lads think this is a good purchase?
im a motion designer and need a lot of power, i had a mac but it gave up on me in a very rude way and i feel betrayed.can a thinkpad replace a macbook pro?
Fucking bullshit. I got mine for 189 and it has the crappy resolution one. It also has scratches and a 6 cell battery.
would it make my x201 run cooler?
Redpill me on the x130eWhy is it so memed for a netbook?
You&#039;ll have to take the motherboard out but it&#039;s well worth it. Especially if it&#039;s still running with original paste.
Swap them. I doubt she will notice.
sound&#039;s risky
Where&#039;s the difficulty?
It&#039;s about compatibility on some devices with specific specification. So if someone have this product and have got any problem with it he can help other people with it.
I&#039;m in Canada and I&#039;m looking for a new laptop for college, it will be used exclusively for hammering out lots and lots of essays and reports, mainly Politics and Economics type stuff, so multiple Office Word files, Excel files and PowerPoint, plus 2-3 Chrome windows with lots of tabs.Wanted to know which of the Lenovo&#039;s you guys would recommend for my uses.
why reddit is so retarded?
Thanks.
Its too late for that pham.

i also bent a little the heatpipe arm for the quadro,  i think it helped and now makes better contact.
Need help here, I saved up around 700 euros for a Thinkpad and I originally wanted to buy a used t450 or smth, but my parents veto-ed my purchase because &quot;you can&#039;t trust used electroncis&quot; so I am stuck to buying a new one . What are my options, I live in Serbia(laptops are 2x the price in stores since there are no official lenovo suppliers) and I have some family in Swiss that is coming for the holidays after New Year. Can I get a decent laptop for 700e ?
T43 caveman here, is there any way to force my system to utilize more than 2GB of RAM because i&#039;m being offered a crapload of DDR2 sticks for peanuts
What Laptop are u can advice me? It should run lol with about 60 fps but also comfy to work and not so expensive
Forgot to add : I am currently studying computer sciences and engineering =&gt; lots of programming/numerical simulations/Matlab ...
do you want to take the laptop to school ? if yes dont take a 15.6 for bulshit like that get a smaler one like mentioned x220/T430 or similiar  and get a desktop for hostel or wherever you gona stay the 15,6 laptops are big and heavy(if you buy a random one) for evri day cary, or get a dock station
HAPPENING FOLKS!!!!PRAISE THE GOD EMPEROR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why can&#039;t you tell your parents to go fuck themselves and spend your money the way you want to? Are they unaware of your powerlevel or does it not exist?
please tell me you&#039;re not delusional enough to actually believe this was a decision IBM made after a political influence
jesus /tpg/ i got a really terrible dreamfuck when my parts will come? am i chinked?
Hey. I m thinking about getting x230 and want to use egpu occasionally, which slot is better, expressport or mpcie ?and which gpu should I get, if I doesnt want overkill for such a setup.Thanks
how much would it cost to build a t601IF in the uk?
20th is the last day it&#039;s expected to arrive so I wake up every day thinking it&#039;ll come but it hasn&#039;t yet ;;
i bought it aliexpress as guest my T420 is really crappy and slow will my t420 be decent in future..
I installed a bit of bloat on it and it&#039;s still smooth but when I get an ssd i&#039;m gonna wipe it and just put i3 and arch on it and leave it
i&#039;d like to see the price for the low profile msi 1050ti when it&#039;s readily available.  one of those paired with an exp gdc beast v8 would be a damn small egpu setup, almost portable!
I&#039;m using cuckdow and feel like dying
dont be stupid. ibm would never bring the old keyboard back if trump wasn&#039;t elected. thats just a fact. winners win.
what are you blabbing about?
Why is the T420 recommended over the T430?  Don&#039;t tell me it&#039;s just because of the keyboard.
Is it a good idea to replace my desktop gaming pc (dont really play games anymore) for a specced out T430 with dock and egpu (in case i want to play games in the future)?Has anyone else sold their desktop and bought a laptop instead?
Thinkpad elitist consider T430 to be a piece of shit because of the keyboard simple as that, I just got a T430 for 200 bucks and am really happy with it.

Thanks Anon (t420 here)  where you keep your GPU? (I can&#039;t found any good solution for this problem)

why do you need windows?
IBM is no longer a hardware company besides specialized items. It stopped making general enterprise hardware years ago
You probably would&#039;ve benefited more from adding an SSD than upgrading to a quad core if your system was feeling sluggish overall. Outside of highly demanding multithreaded workloads, there shouldn&#039;t be anything that really taxes a dual core i5. But a spinning rust drive can make even the simplest tasks take ages.
but thanks, really appreciated your answer
and most program that i use run in to windows..
i refuse to believe south koreans don&#039;t know how to use linux
You might get away with borrowing some of your friends&#039; second display.
god damn, I&#039;m still kicking myself.Saw an X220 for 40$ yesterday with decent specs too i5 3rd gen and so on. It was up for no less than 15 minutes... I think I&#039;m gonna write a script to alert me if this happens again... :(
nvidia cards and their optimus feature are the way to go if you want to use the internal screen. of course there&#039;s a dip in performance vs using an external screen off the gpu itself. my experience with the 750ti and overwatch with high gfx settings: internal screen, 40ish fps, so i locked it to 30. external screen, 60 fps
Get a T450 or any older gen Thinkpad and tell em it&#039;s new.
Do you guys think that the retro thinkpads will actually be revealed on the 25th anniversary?
The whole point is to pack whole lan equipment in one backpack. So I can take taxi.

What is the most one should pay for a X230i?Would this be a good deal?
got this one and am also bidding on a t61 tablet version + a dockhow&#039;d I do? I already have a desktop and needed something to hack on in class
x61*
hey guys, bought a chromebook for school with a celeron processor and needless to say its shit even with Chrome OS. Got it for 100 freedom bucks which honestly feels like a waste since I&#039;, sure you can get a cheaper thinkpad, elitebook, or latitude with vastly superior specs for cheaper. Anything you guys recommend? My only experience with Thinkpad is a T420 which to be honest I didn&#039;t really like. It was too big and the trackpad was absolute shitYeah I get it, but come on if I&#039;m trying to find the most practical form factor I&#039;d like to at least not have to carry a mouse around. Anything smaller than a 420 with a decent trackpad?
blis helpe me frens
gonna build a frankenpad?
that&#039;s one idea I have, yeah
parts are expensive and the individual laptops are hard to find like a flexview t60p and a 4:3 t61
Bump for this
but I&#039;m gonna try scrounging around town for parts first, there&#039;s a decent local community
could always try thinkpad forums as well
x250 in yurop for 500 murribucks that looks like new with fhd ips screen, 256gb ssd 8gb ram and a laptop bag werth?
For about 3 grand you can get a machine with decent desktop workstation tier specs.
for what purpose
Well, I&#039;mma see. If this one doesn&#039;t do it, I&#039;ll get a x270 or t470 as soon as projektneptun offers them. I have nuff muneh anyways : ^) just found that one randomly
x240 vs t430? They are rougly the same price, t430 comes with an ssd and 4Gb of ram, x240 with $gb of ram and a spinny, and the screen is the HD one. x240 is tempting because it&#039;s super light, and I&#039;ll be taking the computer to university everyday. Is the i5 in the x240 enough for normal usage (writing code, web browsing, watching muh anime)?
Anyone know how to clear cosmetic scratches off the rubber lid of old ibm thinkpads?
x220 never came with a 3rd gen i5...
avoid the x230i they come with the lowest end cpus.
What do you guys think of slice batteries for the x220? I&#039;m thinking of getting one but I wanted to know if they are a meme.
thank you. &lt;3
RAM limitations are typically based on the chipset and CPU. You might be able to change the CPU to support more RAM, but the chipset has to support it.

friend is upgrading to a T460, and hes offering me his T420s for about 115USD. I currently have an xps13, but i feel like this is still a solid deal...thoughts?
I was looking for a cheap Laptop so į could install Linux and work with web development. Any comments? Its still not too late to cancel the purchase, i paid 340 euros for it
I think you over paid a bit much especially if all you need it for is webdev.
The P50 is really mediocre. I need to sell mine before ebay prices tank.
I have solid build pc with gtx 1060 and all, but its a table pc, and since I am a student I needed a laptop for just work, no gaming, Also I am living in Europe so the Tech is kinda more expensive than in The USA market, i dont see a problem for paying a bit more if its a good stuff that Will not break atleast for 2-3 years.
i think its a fine deal then, seems perfect for working on the go.
Thanks :) glad to hear :))
internal GPU works fine; the previous poster&#039;s problem is trying to use linux. windows, where you&#039;d actually be playing a game, has no problems.
How significant is the difference between i5-520m and i5-2520m? I&#039;ll be getting either x201 or x220 in the morning, but being poor yuropoorean student that 40$ price difference would make it easier to breathe during Christmas.It&#039;s mainly for CS coursework, web browsing and occasional movie or some digital painting, I don&#039;t really play games.

What&#039;&#039;s the difference between the 50++ and 70++ batteries? Aren&#039;t they both nine cell? I have a 50++ and it is only getting about 4 hours of battery life, should I switch to a 70++?

Bought a T420s for me mum. 2.6 ghz, 8gb RAM, 128 SSD, 1600×900 for $185, did I do well or fuck up for not getting a regular T420? I hear the cpu is soldered on which kinda sucks.
Just got my t430 in the mail and everything about it is perfect besides the mic mute button. I can&#039;t seem to get it to work. Any help? Just did a clean install of windows 10. BIOS is up to date and don&#039;t see any drivers for this sort of thing anywhere.
your mum will be fine with a permanent i5 and under $200 is *not too bad*
it&#039;s handled by lenovo software
So is the battery light on the back of the screen just supposed to constantly be on? The only time it shuts off is if it is fully charged and plugged in, when it is in sleep mode or when it is off.
ya had to install the hotkey bullshit then turn off the osd feature and now it is working
Thinking about getting a newer thinkpad for uni, is ips display worth for the battery sacrifice?
Of course not, what are you talking about?
Try the Windows 7 OSD driver
Is anyone running KDE Neon on the x220? I&#039;m considering to switch from Debian.
but internal GPU is just weak, thats why am I planning to have egpu
somebody find me a good x220 on eBay for around $200
ting/B00666T9VI
is it worth the extra money to buy through Amazon?
That&#039;s considered good? Phew, just bought one like that but with 6GB ram and semi-new 9cell battery for ~185$, was afraid I overpaid a bit.
I was hoping to get one with an SSD

I want a notebook to experiment with Linux distros on. Only things I care about are price and non-shit display. 4GB RAM would be plentiful and I&#039;m going to replace the HDD with an SSD either way. Thanks.
Hi anons. I want to buy msata ssd (crucial m4 msata) for my thinkpad t420 and on lenovo forum they sad that I need to have a recovery DVD disk. Is it true? Can I install Windows 10 without recovery DVDs?

T60 anon.
Thinkpads are garbage computers for autistic manchildren who are poor. I can afford the better computer, the mac.
Received my x220t yesterday and i can&#039;t get the pen pressure to work in Photoshop or gimp but it work fine in the windows sketchpad.I think i tried everything, help.
Reinstal os or buy new pen
Or install w10 instead of 7
I&#039;m on w10
Workstation or gtfo
these drivers worked on my x230t
Less than a month left!
thanks ma nigga
going to buy a t420 to compliment my x220. It&#039;s like they&#039;re the perfect duo, they&#039;re brothers.
If I were you, I would get a WXXX. Getting a T420 beside an X220 doesn&#039;t make much sense to me.
suggests, a W is an option too. But why would you want two portable computers?
what you are looking for is called - &quot;macbook air&quot;
doesn&#039;t say what i5 sadly
She&#039;s a business laptop, anon! Please keep your thought safe for work.

They have equivalent specs and are in fairly similar product categories, what&#039;s the point? You&#039;d have to keep everything synced between them.


Clickies are shit
Clickies are the best. Everyone knows that
ayy lmao
I&#039;m going to check an X230 in a few hours to see if its worth buying it. I&#039;m getting it pretty cheap compared to other sellers in my country.TN panel
keep in mind if you want the performance of an i7, you aren&#039;t able to swap the CPU out on the X series so you&#039;ll have to buy a new mobo.
/tpg/, what keyboard do you use while docked and why isnt it an IBM RT3200?
And even though most people in my program have some kind of business laptop, we still use pen and paper more than anything else.
w2c and how much $
Dude, world&#039;s oldest profession.
where&#039;s the red tactile... waaait.
Anyone know how much a t60 frankenpad is worth nowdays?
It is rubberdome, but its a nice rubberdome and the only TKL with a 3 button trackpoint.
they&#039;re not that great keyfeelwise, though the TPIV is good.  I&#039;d rather pic related tho.
To make or to buy an already completed one? Building one yourself will cost ~$400 total, more if you go for 8gb RAM, a big SSD, or accessories like the advanced dock. Buying outright will cost more, I think I saw a listing for one that was around $600-700 a while ago. It might be worth taking anyway though, just because of how rare the Flexview T60s have become.
That would be really awkward right there though. Its only so comfy on a mouse because you have room to move with it.
how old are you?
I have a T560 I got from work. It&#039;s alright. I definitely prefer my W520 but quite honestly, once you have the TrackPoint back, the new &quot;modern&quot; Thinkpads are more than okay. And yes, they blow the fagbooks out of the water.
On the x220Is there a official part number for the IPS screen? How many models are there for the IPS screen?
anyone using bsd on a x220 or similar gen thinkpad? i am tired of linux and gnu and they can fuck off.
what if it&#039;s not flexview?
i think they are X1 Carbon spare parts,they fit and are compatible with the flat cable
You can use a &quot;compatible&quot; SXGA+ or UXGA TN panel if you can find one for cheap, but those panels really suck. You get the resolution, sure, but the colors and viewing angles make the stock TN panel look good. Not really worth paying for unless you&#039;re desperate.

sxga+ being 1400 and uxga+ being 1600?
if it makes you feel better i am a poor american who cant afford a computer over $150.

I don&#039;t think it&#039;s hardware issue since the windows installation on the same machine doesn&#039;t have half the problems. What the fuck is wrong with the driver for Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6205 cards?
I was looking at a x220 or t420 for a cheap laptop to carry with me to classes and on the train, but thinkpads cost a lot more here in Europe than in the US. ON the other hand, it seems businesses in my country and our surroundings use a lot of latitudes/elitebooks. How are they compared to thinkpads? I&#039;d be looking at the ones with I5-520M/2520M&#039;s. Any major differences I should be aware of?

I mean, I can be all romantic and rally behind linux, but if you want to get anywhere in life you should absolutely use windows as your main platform, this is not up for debate, it&#039;s the best OS, bullshitty or not.
whereabouts in europa are you? you can get a t420 for about 150 quid which is pretty much the same price as in america
Hey guys, just bought a E450 base model (with a 1 TB HDD). It&#039;s a fingerprint magnet. Any tips on keeping it in shape?
so will we see the retro model in a few weeks?on a scale from 1-10, how much will it disappoint us all?
What&#039;s gonna be special about it?
I&#039;ve also got to admit that I kind of dig the looks of elitebooks/latitudes. The thinkspads look neat with their all-black housing, but the I&#039;m also a fan of the aluminium case on the elitebooks and whatever it is that the latitudes have got going. Not that looks are going to make me decide between one or the other, but I like them all.
Have you tried looking on english ebay?
dunno what else, I&#039;m hoping for classical full travel keys and maybe even 3:2/4:3
/tpg/ say something good to me. I ordered a T420s because I thought they are easy to repair but then I saw this disassembly video. Payed 240€.Is there a reason to buy a T420 over a T420s?
Tell me about it. I stopped trying to look locally after about half an hour, and I just set ebay to show everything from the european union.
Bought my first Thinkpad, a T430

T420 has better battery life and a socketed processor so you can upgrade it to a quadcore i7.
i ripped apart a latitude c600. whats this connector called? is it for both video and power?

living in a non-country is suffering
Also, (I&#039;m new to Thinkpads) is is possible to control the fan speed on Linux and Windows?

also yeah you can change the fan speed with thinkfan
I&#039;m on Mint with T420 and the same card, and everything is perfect.
Use thinkfan on Linux and TPFC on Windows.
I actually put this one on mine
Btw, should I pay more a new battery? There are prices from 17€ to 45€. Are the 45€ one 3 times better than a 17€ one? Would like to have 3-5 hours battery for power lurking for the lowest price.
Don&#039;t buy non-genuine batteries. Expect to pay 30-40
You can do that??
yeah, on the left hand side, below the price there&#039;s a category &quot;object location&quot; in my language where I can choose Belgium, EU or worldwide.
Why don&#039;t we have a central eBay website and not country specific then? Portugal has no eBay option
Also does anyone know where I can get a new, less prone to tripping screw for the keyboard?
As i&#039;m transitioning back to windows after a few years on mac, I am very new to this. Is there any essential things I should do to my device in terms of both hardware and software? Thanks anons.
I don&#039;t know senpai. I don&#039;t even know why there even is an option to select Belgium, nobody here sells anything good on ebay. Every time I want to buy something I&#039;m scooting around from German sites to French sites to UK sites. It&#039;s all a bit ridiculous.
I used to have the eff nsa eagle and a subtle fandom sticker on my t420. Now I don&#039;t have any stickers because they got boring to look at.
Also, not sure if I&#039;ll sound like a faggot for saying this, but does anyone here use rainmeter?
use common sense and dont be a fucking idiot downloading shit like on all computers.
Hey /tpg/, care for some help deciding?Battery life doesn&#039;t say, any knowledge on that from the top of your heads?

I actually bought it now. It&#039;s gr8.

Stores in the single market won&#039;t ship to addresses in the single market because fuck you.
It&#039;s a real shame they don&#039;t sell thinkpads or similar laptops on ali, because I&#039;d definately be up to take the plunge. Ali has been consequently good in delivering my shit in a decent time, sometimes even more so than amazon deutschland
I changed my mind.. The extra cost and better display with the same resolution, is not worth the battery life compromise for me. poor viewing angle just means people won&#039;t have their nose up in my shit, and if I want better I&#039;ll get a newer laptop later.
Honestly getting an SSD should be the priority for any memepad owner. You can upgrade the CPU and ram later, but the SSD will make your life much easier, and it is the easiest part to upgrade..
Pretty much. Luckily you can swap it out for the other keyboard.
Also you can use 3rd party batteries
The best layout for maximum speed and data storage per dollar is a mSATA SSD and one or two 7200 RPM drives.
I will upgrade, maybe to a second 256 GB SSD (SATA) and a 1 TB HDD in the ultrabay.
what&#039;s the general opinion on the t430s ?
I have noticed that the HDD is quite loud compared to the fans on average too.
I assume it is quite similar to the T420s i that it has a soldered CPU, less ports, and less battery life compared to it&#039;s normal T4x0 counterpart. If you are fine with these tradeoffs and can get one for cheap, go for it.
Yeah, it can be quite annoying.
serious question.. are storing data there or are you using it for editing and shit like that which will require a lot of &quot;work space&quot;?
well... haven&#039;t really thought about it, currently i have a t410, which is sitting 90% of the time on a docking station, so ports should not be a problem.... 90% of the time. So i guess it should be fine. What would less battery life mean btw ? Also, are they really that hot ? And yeah, I think i can get it for cheap.
Storing shit. My T420 is currently my main computer.
Is the wifi card upgradable on the T420 without hacking with BIOS whitelists? If yes, what is the best card available?
If I clone my Win 7 install from a regular SSD to an mSATA, will Windows boot? (I know I should try it myself, yes...)
And if you already have Win7 on an SSD why would you transfer it to mSATA? SATA does 6 gb/s, mSATA does 3. Get the mSATA for the triple drive setup, but use it for other stuff.
If it clones over the bootloader partition then most likely. I have never done it with windows, but OSX worked.
I have just done a clean install + config. My system is so incredibly comfy I have never felt this good with an OS. You have a point there though. I have an OCZ 240 GB SSD for Win7 + programs, and the original 320 GB HGST HDD for filez n shit. What would I even use a 120-240 GB mSATA SSD for... I&#039;m getting memed here.
Might as well just get a 1tb HDD for the ultrabay. The WD Black is 75-ish bucks at the moment.
What should I buy for maximum battery life:weight ratio for &lt;$300 all in? Is x220 w/ 9 cell my best bet? I&#039;m hoping for 8h+ of usage on a charge, and I&#039;ll probably install xubuntu or something similar.
0B4QESVQ
Tell them to fuck themselves
Pretty neat. Might get one.
No idea. I have one and it works ok. HGST is supposedly the most reliable HDD brand.
Shoot me in the skull
feels good man
then why use a SSD if you&#039;re just storing shit?
Why wouldnt I?
sweet mother of shit
On Laptops it makes sense using SSDs for storage.
I don&#039;t need to look to the keyboard when I type, so it doesn&#039;t bother me.
how exactly does it make sense?
The SSD was a gift and I have 3 batteries (2 9 cells and 1 6 cell, all over 80% capacity) so i couldnt really give less of a shit about battery life.
One fall and your HDD might get damaged, which wont happen with SSDs.
do you have that problem? if my laptop were to fall the hard drive failing is the least of my concerns. im not shitting on you for having ssd, its your choice. Just curious as to the why, I have a 30gb msata and ill have something in the bay either another 64gb ssd i already had or nothing else, I don&#039;t keep files on my computer just in case. I usually have a external hd.
You make our ThinkPad community look bad.
Am I the only one who throws my X220 around because it&#039;s faster?
garbage
Perhaps not the best thread to ask, but has there ever been another laptop with a Wacom tablet integrated in the palm rest other than the W700? I think it&#039;d be pretty cool, but W700 is a bit too much laptop for me. I&#039;d even take one completely replacing the touchpad.
Can I upgrade my thinkpad t520 to an Nvidia card? If so, should I get a Nvidia card or an FHD screen?
X series tablets have a giant wacom pad. The entire screen in fact.
thanks
Sure, but I&#039;d like to try out the palm rest version. Not just for the novelty: with swivel-screen tablets the keyboard isn&#039;t available when in drawing mode, and I don&#039;t want to get or plug in a separate keyboard for when I&#039;m doing art.
b-but SSD&#039;s uses up less power..
You can, but it&#039;s not much better than the integrated. Go for the 1080p screen first.
time to replace this Compaq&#039;s screaming 20-gig Travelstar and reinstall Win98.
The E6420/E6430 are pretty good. Not all model have the clit, and the keyboard is different from the T420, but its still significantly better than the island hunt and peck shits, No mSata support though, but you can chuck another drive into the DVD slot with a cradle
Windows 7 Pro 64-bit (UK English)
KDE is not a distro. You can install KDE on Debian. Do you even know why you want KDE?
hey /tpg/, I&#039;m looking for a new laptop and saw this deal for a used Lenovo T450 for $590 AUD(which is $436 USD). Wondering if you guys think this is good value? Why I ask is because it&#039;s a bit outside my budget, but still might be worth considering if it&#039;s a good deal. What do you think?
MDL forums are fucking wonderful. The first thing I learned when I got my first PC is how to get and install pirated and other software. Do that.
Truth. Laptop spinners, all of them, are garbage.

In other news, is there a way to upgrade the t410s speakers?
keep in mind that all the hardware has been checked and works fine
If you&#039;re not using them then they will actually use more power compared to mechanical
Oi /tpg/Any ideas?
I never had any issues, whats your wireless card?
Which laptop is best with drawing screen? Im looking at a X230 Tablet with i7 3th gen for around 370. Is it worth it these days?
 Intel centrino wireless n-1000
bought a x200 with 2,4ghz, 2gb ram and put a ssd in it.Is it broken, or what could be the reasons, also any diagnostics tools I can run on linux or in bios?
God fucking damn I had forgotten how visually cancerous win7 was Fixed it f am

what model is this??
I have a Thinkpad T440p with a 9 cell battery that is not even 2 years old, but it&#039;s already unable to hold more than 2 hours of charge when doing office stuff on power saver and screen brightness all the way downI thought that Thinkpad batteries are able to survive for much longer since this was supposed to hold 8 hours of charge to begin with
Without knowing anything I would tell you to do a windows reinstall and install the proper drivers from lenovo and fuck around with the energy settings. You have one of the longest lasting laptops in the world on a single charge, something ain&#039;t right.
2001 Compaq Presario 1800T
I realised that later sorry, what is this for?
I have Winshit 10 and the Lenovo power manager doesn&#039;t work with it, but I have the power management drivers installed
So I suggest you try fucking around with the energy settings on a fresh install. Why a fresh install? Because I don&#039;t know what you got on your laptop and it is simply the weakest link in the troubleshooting process. I&#039;d even tell you to try it with Win7 if it is possible/doable for you simply because you can&#039;t control what Win10 is doing, the OS itself could be the cause of your problems.
I feel bad for you, keep on looking. I got my W500 for $150 CAD and I love it.
This thread is about the appreciation of watches, as well as the micro-engineering and materials engineering that are required to make a fine watch.
First for Tudor
2rd for new LM special and a successfully nabbing a black turtle for 215$.
good buys
yes that and the part that it wasn&#039;t really that well made anyway and I lost interest in watches in general. The alpha is just an toy anyway and its toy money.

nine balls
So what makes them so special?
I have been really starting to love the explorer 1, I don&#039;t know why but it looks increasingly more attractive every time I look at it.I have only been interested in dive watches for the longest time so I have no idea about this shit.
I just received this as a company christmas gift.It looks dusty because the protective sticker is still on it

The SARG009 is kind of similar, but not quite.
SARG009 (or 007 if you&#039;re willing to shell 500$), otherwise one of the Seiko Alpinists like the SARB017.
Also the SARG005.
Yeah I&#039;ve come across that one before in my searches, I would have bought it instantly if the numerals on it weren&#039;t so colossal.
why not? they are not expensive to return
Timex make an Explorer 1 homage.
Timex has many nice designs, being &quot;American&quot;, but their movements and build quality are absolute shit. I wish they&#039;d just go with Miyotas and SII&#039;s like the rest.
Engineering and manufacturing quality. I&#039;ve handled a Sinn 856 up close and the manufacturing quality is obvious. Plus a stock ETA 2892-A2 or Soporod A10-2 is in my view better than Omega&#039;s co-axial meme.
So far i&#039;m considering: extra thicc zulu, simple nato, vintage regimental perlon, or haram leather.
Well I guess I can definitely see the value in a truly well-made and solidly designed watch with a generic movement, priced fairly. Especially for utilitarian watches.
So basically anything.
Guess i&#039;ll get that regimental perlon while it&#039;s dirt cheap.
Nth for Seagull 1963
I&#039;m buying a fake watch. Which one?
A fake Komandirskie.
still waiting for someone to tell me the downsides of a bulova accuswiss chronographif I wanted to spend a couple grand, I&#039;d save for a speedy, but if I&#039;m only spending 500 I&#039;m not going to be as picky
Both are ugly to me.
Right because flat tummy and nice pits
It&#039;s pretty fucking ugly. Those indices are gross.
First part of rayskin strap. I&#039;ll do the other half tonight when I get home from work.
An explorer i is a dress watch.  Explorer ii is a mountaineering watch.
a158
A fake F-91W.
Literally dog shit tier quartz fashion watch.
It was free and yet you still paid too much.
i like the ray skin itself but the stitching seems really thick and out of place
looks breddy gud, but that cutting mat is disgusting bruh
there are a few models and stock photos never show a watch well
whoever posted this: that&#039;s one sexy mutha
outdoorsy active gentlemans watch, in the same vein as the Alpinist without the loud colors on the dial.  I like the owl penis fine but the green and gold isn&#039;t exactly subtle
It&#039;s a real shame that seiko seems to have discontinued the white/gold alpinist. Not the current sarg one, but the one with the sexy hands.
Thanks, bud.
Fucking nigger mods.
sorry, i didn&#039;t think posting just the link was going to be an issue.
What&#039;s your favorite daily /g/ents?

steel bezel or black bezel?methinks the steel bezel
Steel would only work if polished.
I don&#039;t know how much I will actually use the tachymeter
Seriously, this needs to stop.
I like the dial on the one with the black bezel better. What material is the bezel made of?
Never said that.
amazon says stainless steel but the paint makes it look like plastic to me
Painted bezles are bad news. It&#039;s just asking to get fucked up.
It will tell time and it looks fine I guess. We are a bunch of snobs though, so you will likely not get praise for this.

I wouldn&#039;t recommend you buy one, but it looks decent and I would definitely wear it over nothing.
Too bad it has a habit of out right stopping for no reason. I don&#039;t wear it much but I might take it to a clockworkers shop.
Picked this up awhile back and still on love with it. The pinstripe dial and blue hands are eye catching.
Nothing but commiewatches and nipwatches.
I polished an SNK809 that I bought for my brother for Christmas.  Looks pretty okay.
I visited a Swatch store today (I had time to kill). I wanted to see the Sistem51, since I had read about it and it seemed interesting to see in the flesh.I would love to know how they sell the mechanical thing to someone who isn&#039;t already interested, though. I&#039;ll have to check out another shop and feign ignorance to find out. I will make sure to point out how retarded it is to wear a watch that is more expensive and less accurate.
thanks for the blog post
For what reason?
That bezel looks good. The lug seems weird from this picture though.
That&#039;s a special kind of autism.
Aren&#039;t you interested in the Sistem51, anon? It&#039;s a shame to just dismiss it as crap and move on. I find it much more interesting to find out exactly how trash it is, and in which ways it might not be totzl trash.
Could work with a rugged leather strap.
Please point out the autism to me. I&#039;m too autistic and can&#039;t figure out what you mean.


hey fuck you guys, I just handled a hamilton khaki in the flesh and it was pretty gud.it seems like a perfectly viable option for me, although I don&#039;t have a seiko boutique near me to handle a sarb.
Today was our Christmas Lunch at work and a lot of the Big Wigs at my company were here for the event. I work for a European Company in the Energy Business and the term &quot;Disposable Income&quot; takes on a meaning that most can never imagine.I can safely state that 99% of the people you see daily have no idea whatsoever that you are wearing a &quot;Fake&quot; watch. Having that conversation is just plain silly!
It is dangerous to wear an fake, especially the day when I come and ask you if I can try your watch.
But why?

Man on the fucking moon of course

My usual and at the moment only go to beater, at least until either the turtle arrives or i decide to order a new case for the Amphibia.

Noone is dissing the Hamilton you tard.
For the fun of it, and it literally makes you look like a vain criminal in the normie eyes when I reveal you.
wait a while
Was thinking of buying a Sea urchin, would this be a good first buy for a non quartz watch?
On a separate note, what do you guys think about the bulova moon watch? Or should I go for the much cheaper alpha speedmaster?
How is it not a diver? It&#039;s styled like a diver and has adequate WR for recreational diving, what more does it need?
It is good for swimming but not diving. I think it is a good choice. There are also some nice mods you can do if you get bored with it.
Either way it&#039;s a sports/recreational diver, decent choice for babby&#039;s first mechanical.
Bulova has watches with a 7750 that are thinner than that.
Where can I learn more of what mods I can do with this watch?
Alpha is trash, the Bulova Moonwatch is probably the only good-looking watch Bulova makes today.
I&#039;m pretty sure there are pelagos, sub, fifty fathoms, and other non-homage mods out there.
this is the model that most mods use.  It&#039;s usually cheaper, looks better stock, and has more mods available to it because that bezel style is what many make inserts for
There&#039;s nothing quite like driving through a literal fucking blizzard to get some dim sum at a place so Cantonese they call Mandarin speakers gewilo...the joys of being a fat Canadian.
Thanks for the help
Feels comfy, man!

What kind of snow tires do you have on, my fat friend from Toronto? And do you have a chronograph to time your commute and see how much the snow has delayed you? It&#039;s bitching cold in London right now, by the way.
the bond edition seamaster has a neat rotor that goes about 4/5 of the way around, but I doubt it is weighted specially

yeah, you can tell it is weighted similarly to a normal rotor.
This is the nicest Vostok ever. Which model is this??
What the salesman said is complete bullshit, regardless.
a circular rotor that is weighted evenly will barely spin at all
I&#039;m strongly considering picking one of these up just for the antimagnetism. Can any other watches come close? I know sinn has some on the order of the milgauss, but I&#039;m not sure I have seen one match the Aqua Terra specs.
710007, with a custom Amphibia SE bezel.
but what kind of magnetic fields are you exposed too?
On the average day just electronics but depending on the week they can get to the 10^3 gauss range. Every once in a while a couple Tesla. Probably won&#039;t go near those again until spring.
Pretty sure the SBGR077/079 can also fit if you&#039;re just going for a/m resistance.
Digital watches aren&#039;t going to be affected significantly by magnetism if they aren&#039;t solar or radio controlled I would imagine.
f-91w
Great suggestions. I didn&#039;t know about the IWC. This will definitely make picking something harder down the road.
Lego Batman watch
yo where my seikoshills at
Wearing my SARX013 right now
Probably going to order an 035 next week.
at least stienhart can get that right
/wt/ I&#039;m looking for a watch.Anyone know watches that fit this description under 1500USD?
n-no bully
Can&#039;t see shit cap&#039;n
SNKK71 reporting in.
what&#039;s wrong with the crystal?  no AR coating?
What&#039;s /wt/&#039;s opinion on Nixon?
&quot;The presence of a unidirectional bezel with at least at every 5 minutes elapsed minute markings and a pre-select marker to mark a specific minute marking.&quot;
normie fashion watch garbage
could be a steel engraved bezel or marked another way
I never got this...  The fake has shit quality,  the original has great quality and the original is about the same price or even cheaper than the fake. It&#039;s like buying fake paper clips made from literal paper that cost as much or more than real paper clips. You won&#039;t impress anyone and if anyone notice then they will question your sanity.
Yes, but he asked for flat &amp; unpainted. Wouldn&#039;t having it engraved or imprinted by whatever means no longer make it flat?
no
flat and no coating as far as i can tell
Clearly I have failed to understand.
I had an IT guy come give a presentation to my office, and he was wearing a Rolex GMT Master II. I think it was a steel model, so not the new 6 digit ceramic, but the hand stack is the tell. For the life of me, I could not get a good enough look at it to tell if the hand stack was CHS or not. I mean I spent the entire time trying to figure it out, lol. Regardless it was a beatifull TT piece, looks just my TT TC sub in pic related, but a GMT.
Looks good, wear it in good health
I&#039;d say go for that
Alpha makes a better one for like 80 bucks
Truth is some reps are so good it is near impossible to tell on the wrist
That looks pretty good, if the bracelet hadn&#039;t been such a bitch to put on mine I&#039;d consider swapping to a perlon like that on occasion.
Meme blue, now on perlon
Hola, amigos. Hace un año conocí una chica que se hacía pasar por otra, pero inocentemente no lo supe. La verdad, estaría interesado en saber quién era la chica delas fotos, por ello, busco ayuda en éste foro a ver si alguien me ayuda a dar con ella. Mil gracias. A cambio hay una recompensa.Hello friends. A year ago I met a girl pretending to be another, but innocently I did not know. The truth, I would be interested to know who the girl was the photos, so I look for help in this forum to see if someone helps me to find her. Thank you. In exchange there is a reward.
what&#039;s the reward
The reward would be spoken when they find it, depends on the interests of each person
install gentoo
Thank you, my friend. I&#039;ll try
It&#039;s done, we found here. PM sent ;)
The fuck is this thread even

Sent, check your PM box. ;)
Thank you, Where do I find pm? I&#039;m new
In your inbox
post 20x on /v/ and you unlock the pm option in settings
you have to go back
OP, unfortunately to check your PM you have to install an OS called &quot;Gentoo&quot;, it&#039;s not that complicated and it will be worth it.
  Hey man, I do not know how to do it. I am not speak english
Pero que chingados es esto.
i am not speak english too
Will I need to uninstall windows? I do not understand haha, is there no other way?
I use the translator xd
OP, every linux distro has the 4ch_pm package in its package manager. Just install one of them, like Slackware, and you&#039;ll be fine.
How do I stop feeling guilty about not working non stop? Apart from things all humans do plus going to the gym, I feel guilty about any of my habits. And I have no goals.The awful thing is that I know everyone else is a fraud. That NFL player who everyone loves and says is hardworking has never read a book. That mathematics professor known as a genius is a disgusting dyel. That literary figure who goes on about Shakespeare being a god doesn&#039;t know any maths or science greater than an 18 year old yet claims to be worldly. That billionaire who goes on about humanity&#039;s big issues does nothing but write checks for people who make social media apps.
wow thats alot of words
http://variety.com/2016/biz/news/fction-net-neutrality-fcc
As much as it sucks shit, it was going to happen one way or another.
How is Net Neutrality targeting conservative media? Does he mean they can&#039;t work if you have anything else to browse besides Foxnews?
It&#039;s not hard poorfags
If only internet plans actually worked that way.
This has nothing to do with concept of Net neutrality.
don&#039;t like it make your own internet, entitled babies
where I live the price cubic meter of water declines the more you use
Nice bait.
You big government cucks will never understand this, and you&#039;ll always cry and cry for more and more regulation. Hopefully someday you&#039;ll see that the reason we have the current asinine level of ISP quality is because of government intervention in the first place.
On what grounds do you think that less regulation will make for a better Internet?
This is literally only a issue in America. Thank God for our state controlled ISP. The state controlled ISP can not do anything that the public dislikes and all private ISPs have to do better than the state isp to survive. So the data caps, expensive internet, and removing net neutrality won&#039;t happen here unless something huge changes
He literally has no idea what net neutrality is. He&#039;s a conspiracy theorist like the rest of his fanbase.
You don&#039;t write laws to compensate for those shitty ones. You repeal the shitty ones and let the free market fucking work for once. See: literally any city in america that doesn&#039;t have these fucktarded rules in place.
coincidentally, anybody know the value of a cubic meter of internet?
The GOP has always (since the early 1900s) been the party of big business and large corporations. These policy positions are favorable to large corporations (who back GOP members of congress).
What about repealing shitty ones and keeping the law that forbids ISP to throttle users&#039; traffic depending on which site they are accessing?
Yeah, but I&#039;m already paying for electricity so why should I pay to send a small amount of electricity over wires that the company charging me doesn&#039;t even fully control?
Don&#039;t matter, his fans will eat anything he shits out.Anything.

Given the choice, I&#039;d rather let the PEOPLE decide on who and what they want to serve them internet. At the end of the day, money is the best way to cast a vote, and when you remove barriers from casting said vote in the way you want, it works pretty fucking well.
**Downloads torrents without a care in the world**
The free market is what&#039;s causing ISPs to try to tear down net neutrality. You&#039;re saying the internet is better without net neutrality and better off controlled by your ISP. Frankly, you&#039;re a fucking moron. But it&#039;s your opinion so there&#039;s no arguing with you.
???
What do you mean THE party? The democrats are exactly the same with different rhetoric.


Great argument.
Who is going to be lobbying for blocking sites?
When we actually have a lot of ISPs to choose from instead of guy who rips you off and guy who sucks, then we can drop net neutrality.
This is an example of something that could happen.
Comcast does it, but they get shat on.
Precedent says gov can now control what isp&#039;s can throttle and not throttle.
We already have data caps and throttling.
There has been reports that the FCC might end data caps. Doesn&#039;t look likely now.
Anyway, I&#039;m out for now.
where? in bum fuck nowhere with your freedom loving republican governor?
Seems like the alternative without net neutrality is no lobbying is necessary, ISPs just do what they want.
So you would rather ISPs just do whatever they want? You need some government regulation.
You can&#039;t make this shit up senpai.
So what you&#039;re saying is that your legislation system is so inflexible that you are physically incapable of enacting a law that would forbid ISP from throttling users&#039; traffic, and you see the best solution as just saying fuck it, removing all existing legislations and hoping it all sorts it out itself in the end?
I&#039;d be okay with that if there wasn&#039;t a flat rate of like $60 before taking into account usage.
Because bribery exists there should be no regulations? What of kind of reasoning is that?
*pays anyway*
We&#039;ll charge you $50 whether you use 10000 gallons or not. Also, if you go over 10000 gallons, we&#039;ll charge you another $50.
Competition is supposed to fight that.
The rest just pay for it. If you aren&#039;t tech minded, then you have no idea what you&#039;re paying for, or whether it&#039;s worth it, fair or not.
Which begs the question, are all good regulations actually bad because they&#039;ll probably lead to bad regulations one day? Wouldn&#039;t the end of this logic mean that we shouldn&#039;t have any regulations at all? Can we imagine anything the government can regulate that they can&#039;t also fuck up royally?
I supported trump all the way since the primaries but ending net neutrality will really suck.
They did
Competition fights apathy towards competition?
Why do you need a government solution to a problem which doesn&#039;t exist and can only be created by the government?
Even hosting your own server is going to be a pain. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if you have to get some sort of government license to have one.
I can&#039;t speak for America, but everyone knows how to count his money in my country, even normies.
You deserve to hang
What are some laws that make it illegal to make a competing ISP? Will trump fight for the little guy and help make it possible for small ISPs to exist?
This problem can be created by a monopoly.
Can we stop pretending that someone can win with 3 million less votes and still call this a democracy? The people didn&#039;t choose Trump. The system did.
Only a limited amount of companies can even get access to utility polls
If you don&#039;t think the government controls your internet in America you&#039;re an idiot
It&#039;s called republic. It&#039;s not called democracy.
The united states is a republic, not a democracy :^)
nihilist
please google natural monopoly
This is good news. Commies gtfo
As a trend, people seek the best products and services at the lowest price. Market economies are the most successful and that would probably be impossible if that wasn&#039;t true.
None of this is going to be an overnight thing. This will be a cat and mouse game for decades.
Just because a Republican president got in office doesn&#039;t make it a republic retard. It&#039;s a democracy (and it&#039;s not because we had a Democratic president)
I&#039;m so happy he will fuck net neutrality in the US, this is the best way to punish Americans for electing him in the first place, I&#039;m smiling right nowt. Swiss
And who enforces monopolies? If a monopoly were to be so benevolent that it offered a service nobody else could possibly beat, then it wouldn&#039;t be a problem in the first place. A monopoly is only a problem when it offers trash service, and the only way a monopoly can stay a monopoly by offering trash service is by having the government regulators curb competition.
It&#039;s not a democracy. It&#039;s a Democratic Republic. Our country&#039;s founding fathers hated Pure Democracy.
You&#039;re mixing up your arguments. You&#039;re both saying that getting rid of net neutrality will be a good thing and at the same time saying we can preserve net neutrality in a free market. What exactly do you want?

The backlash will be great. It&#039;s like you forget what happened with PIPA and SOPA.

For a board that loves nostalgia, they sure do forget about 10 FREE HOURS
Oh... ok, sure. Ok. Why not?
You could have had 100 mb internet since the Clinton administration, he mounted some of those himself with Al Gore.
We should repeal all laws. It&#039;s a slippery slope!
I have 300mbits symmetric connection and a rival ISP constantly trying to poach me off my current ISP.
Fuck it all.
Nope. The rate of return on capital (r) is greater than the rate of economic growth (g). Free market don&#039;t work.
I guess Wheeler should have spent a few million dollars on lawyers to protect his new business from being sued into oblivion by the competition.
Not going to happen you fucking bellend.
...Why on earth can&#039;t evil people at least be progressily evil?&quot;When I become president, I&#039;ll impose net neutrality, forcing companies to waste billions of dollars on advertisement without a curated, corporate internet! WAHAHAHAHAAAA!!!&quot;
Say what you will but Hillary was utterly incapable of presenting her side of things in an effective argument that resonated with the country. Did anyone voting for her really believe she was against the TPP? That she wouldn&#039;t be a total warmonger like all recent presidents? Or were they just voting for her because &#039;muh womyn&#039; and &#039;muh gay lgbt rights :))&#039;
This sounds like a liberal Mr. Burns.
Because this shit invariably includes a lot of riders like &quot;must not spread hate speech&quot;.
Kek. Ask Canadians.
Money wants Money, regardless of what color they paint their bus,

How about that Hitler guy?
US has always been a democratic republic. It is not a democracy
Democracy don&#039;t mean 1 vote per citizen. For example the &quot;parliament&quot; in Athens was selected by civic lottery (lottery; like jury duty in the US). This was still a democracy.
The natural response to the Versailles Treaty, the ensuing currency collapse &amp; political disarray, and the Jewish exploitation thereof.
democratic republic
fuck telecoms
ANYONE?
Trump is wrong on this how do we correct his path with memes.
Bandwidth is far cheaper then water dumb ass. Also the more people use the cheaper the infrastructure is per data. The prices are monopoly driven break up the companies and allow competition or embrace regulation like net neutrality.
The only way is to either somehow create a second internet, or find a way to bypass these ISP&#039;s
I don&#039;t think this should surprise anyone, voters knew going in Trump was against an open and neutral internet. Sorry about your country, you&#039;re in for a rough few years.
Is it going to be safe to pirate things under Trump?
There&#039;s a difference between being critical and telling outright lies about a person to damage them. Guess which one he&#039;s actually talking about when he means extend libel laws?
don&#039;t like public roads?  build your own
I can&#039;t roll my eyes hard enough.
Was this Russia&#039;s plan all along? To get Trump into power to cuck us while they make bank?
Yep, and the Russians are making illegal migrants rape and assault people in Europe.
The Russians also hacked the airplanes to crash into the world trade center.
Is there anything the Russian hackers CANNOT do?
Oh is this the jump to conclusions board? I&#039;ve heard about this board from office space.
You know where to go back to, cuck.
???? who said anything about roads?
You retards have never complained about the electoral college before until Trump won. Get fucked, leftshit.


poorfag BTFO

The controversy was over Florida flipping after the recount, not the electoral college itself you stupid children.
Ok this guy has to be underage
You&#039;re projecting.
If you had even bothered to check wikipedia you would know that Gore won the popular vote.
I didn&#039;t say otherwise. You must be illiterate.
my point is that nobody who actually wants an internet where free speech is untempered has the resources to supplant the old infrastructure with new infrastructure.  we&#039;re never going to have the laissez-faire utopia fantasy that ancaps cum in their dreams over.  if the internet gets fucked, there&#039;s no do-overs.
As if the popular vote matters in a Presidential election.
It matters if you&#039;re going to claim that the PEOPLE made their choice
Barely anyone actually voted for Clinton anyway.
Also, the fact that you so vehemently opposed voter ID laws dimishes your credit when you get a lot of votes.
Why are you assuming that I&#039;m a democrat?
That&#039;s a complete lie. You are ignoring the cemetery voters, illegal immigrant voters, and the animal voters. What a fucking bigot.


liberal behavior 101
They don&#039;t produce &quot;internet&quot;.  The whole idea of charging for usage has no basis but profit and many execs have been caught saying such before.  The only people that can maybe be said to produce &quot;internet&quot; are content creators and other website operators.  Considering the desperate pleas of many organizations over ad blockers, this makes sense.
wow..... really makes you think.........
That&#039;s not an argument. I voted Republican. You&#039;re not helping the cause.
wrong
Are you stupid?
/pol/ in a nutshell t b h
name calling.  LOL


Walls should be built around the latter.
Good, it&#039;ll keep the former out when their Trickle Down Economics bite them in their inbred asses.
Of course it&#039;s Democrats who are calling on electors on both sides to ignore the votes of tens of millions of voters and vote for someone other than Clinton or Trump.
SMASH THE SYSTEM!
Clearly it was racism, and not your elitism, that won Trump not just the presidency but the senate and all houses, too.
nah
back to /r/breitbart with you
Keep calling the majority of Americans flyover hicks or whatever, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll win them over.
I can&#039;t wait for America&#039;s internet to get fucked and watch /pol/ do mental back flips to somehow find excuses why it&#039;s not Trump&#039;s fault.
T-Trump will make the i-internet great, again...
TFW you realize about 1/3 of the country vote on the behalf of the country.I hate democrat now.
kek, we&#039;re going to have 8 years of this.
Fucking nice bait /pol/.
It&#039;s the same reason why fringe radicals (I.E. Trump, the &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;alt-reich&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;) shouldn&#039;t be given the time of day when their agendas are in extreme misalignment with the population centers of a country
It should be worth more because American cities are utterly shit
Enjoy pay 100$ to use &quot;minor sites&quot; like 4chan.
That&#039;s never going to happen
?
Why not? You trust in the Comcast or Verizon?
Oh boy, can&#039;t wait for the ceo of att, comcast, or verizon to be the new fcc chairmen.
Drain the swamp directly into the white house
Competition doesn&#039;t really exist for a majority of America in regards to ISPs. This is by far the biggest issue that really just won&#039;t ever be addressed without significant work. As it stands, outside of a major city in the US you&#039;re lucky if you even have access to two ISPs of comparable quality. There&#039;s just no choice, you either have the service in town or you have nothing/magnitudes worse speeds. There&#039;s not really an avenue for competition to startup in either. People aren&#039;t going to dump massive amounts of cash to roll out new lines, especially when there&#039;s no guarantee that they can cut into the existing company&#039;s userbase. We forget sometimes but most people just don&#039;t care about the quality of what they&#039;re getting. There are plenty of grandmas out there who either just don&#039;t care since what they get works &quot;well enough&quot;, or just don&#039;t know that it could be better. The only way you could do this is to have a preexisting company drop stacks and hope it works (see google fiber, also see how they gave up expanding that service), or by having massive subsidies in favor of new companies as to encourage competition.
The swamp just got ten feet deeper!
The alt right was a way to describe how people in the internet, like 4chan, used mischief to express themselves across twitter and YouTube. You can thank Milo for making this mainstream and having the media think it is a real thing.
Hey retard, water is a finite, tangible resource whereas bandwidth is only a rate of usage. If networks can support everyone using the Internet how they&#039;ve been doing so for over two decades (and they can), why should people who have been paying the same amount suddenly have to pay more? Have you considered the fact that people who don&#039;t go over Comcast&#039;s new 1TB cap PAY THE SAME AMOUNT AS THEY DID BEFORE? Did you know that EVERYONE has the SAME SPEEDS regardless of their previous plan? Why is this? It&#039;s because Comcast isn&#039;t upgrading it&#039;s infrastructure in any way. Its customers will be using the same network only with more restrictions in order to squeeze more money out of them. Hey, if you could rub two brain cells together you&#039;d understand that it&#039;s nothing more than to increase profits of an already incredibly profitable business. I bet you also think that wealth = intelligence.
Jokes on you. I&#039;m going to pay $95 a month for all access.
Get fucked
don&#039;t even bother
It&#039;s not about the 40 residents, it&#039;s about the State itself. Each state should have &quot;equal&quot; voting power dependent on population of said state
Muh trust in megacorps.
The difference of votes between Clinton and Trump is only 2%, almost 3 million out of 130 million.
People forget that the US is actually supposed to be a collection of sovereign states. While interstate commerce was done to fuck that over, our glorious constitution is written to acknowledge this.
Again, where is proof any ISP says they&#039;d do this or are thinking of doing it.
If we had 5-10 ISPs competing in one city, and one of them decided to go full retard and not do net neutrality, would it matter? Not really, because Americans would have the choice of using a different one. The problem is that ISPs are monopolies, and they are monopolies because of government regulations that they effectively wrote. If we do not remove those government regulations, then we can justify regulations such as net neutrality on the basis that these companies are government-regulated monopolies.
pick one and only one
Or not enough regulation allowed them to merge and control too much infrastructure.
&quot;Please /g/, the ISP are the the good guys&quot;. This is like a paid shill.
So you have nothing than a decade old mocked up infograph without sources.
How about I pick both because that&#039;s how it is and that&#039;s how it works
Do you forget about the past of AT&amp;T and the federal support to their monopoly?
Bro, your face is so stupid.
In fact what I think would be even better is charging based on usage is to charge more during peak hours so that the system will be loaded more evenly throughout the day. You can torrent at night cheaply when all the kids get off youtube.
Hey fucktard, I pay for 50Mbps down whereas others pay for 100 or even 1Gbps. Might want to revisit your bullshit. There is not a linear $ per Mbps relationship.
Congratulations, anon.
Hey retard, you don&#039;t run out of bandwidth over time. The worst that happens is congestion which causes slowdowns, but if you could comprehend what you&#039;re reading you understand that I pointed that out in my previous post.
Was fucking great bait.
Probably the dumbest person in the thread right here.
Mergers would not be a problem if new ISPs were allowed to pop up.
So they had a payment plan for sites?
no u
in a majority white country controlled by white people at nearly every level and are &quot;oppressed&quot; by poor mexican immigrants.
Make America low skilled, high wage again
ad hoc networks are the answer
Reap what you sow, faggot. Enjoy the meme your elected destroying all you love.
Trump knows the internet got him elected. He won&#039;t fuck with it.
ideology

yeah that sounds ok to me
They don&#039;t believe in it.
Fuck you.
t. Canadian who experienced telecom deregulation 2 years ago
regulations are not inherently beneficial, but some regulation is definitely necessary
You should be honored to pay a higher rate in capitalist America.
lmao
Why don&#039;t data caps in America ensure that you have net neutrality?ISPs can&#039;t complain about congestion if you&#039;ve already pre-booked the usage which you will use.
yeah, /pol/ is just a few doors down, while plebbit is way down the street. why not fuck off there so you can be farther away from the meanies at /pol/, faggot?
Of course it won&#039;t, but it&#039;s an important first step to fixing the ISP market. If you have ordinences where a new ISP can&#039;t setup infrastructure because Comcast has zoning rights, or AT&amp;T owns the telephone poles and the city says you can&#039;t use them or erect your own, then how he hell is competition supposed to happen?
Most people in America don&#039;t have data caps.
He doesn&#039;t even know what it is. He ia just an old dude who probably has 0 grasp on the internet. Im sure my dad wouldn&#039;t have a problem with slow Internet datacaps preferential traffic and what have you either. Seriously just try explaining the internet to a 70+ year old dude. People forget trump is old and senile.
A monopoly wasn&#039;t guaranteed in theory and competition eventually formed (and recently started to go bankrupt, meaning we may return to a monopoly again), but in reality one existed for a significant amount of time and may form again.
And regulations have never really proven effective when it comes to breaking it up. At best you have multiple companies colluding and not even fully realising economies of scale.
this is actually a pretty good explanation, thanks anon
It&#039;s a shame the plan was all but scrapped a few years ago after a change in government.
Trump isn&#039;t consistent on anything to a degree of predictability. He says he&#039;s against regulation in the abstract, fine, but I haven&#039;t heard him utter one word about competition.
My worry with government ISP would be we&#039;d all get the same $300/month 25mbps connections and have no fucking options otherwise.
This makes the most sense to me because infrastructure is a good example of what the market doesn&#039;t do well. Competitors wouldn&#039;t share lines or poles, and its retarded to erect new poles and lines whenever you switch services. The government might do a shitty job of maintaining it, like our other infrastructure systems, but at least any competitor can plug in and we actually have a competitive system.
Also it wouldn&#039;t cost that much in the slightest. Government operates on the fullest economy of scale possible and at 0 profit.
He&#039;s mentioned this plenty of times in interviews, at his rallies, and even in his 2015 book. What else is he going to do? Do you think because he&#039;s rich that automatically means he&#039;s going to do every other rich person personal favors? That&#039;s certainly possible, but there&#039;s no indication that will happen.
And before you mention how that&#039;s vauge; it&#039;s only vague in how he intends to create competition. There&#039;s no ambiguity about whether he&#039;s pro-competition or not based on everything he&#039;s said and everything he&#039;s written.
Post your component list, rate other anons&#039;, ask questions in general.
Talk me out of upgrading fromAlso might not do all in one go, but wait for later paychecks. I&#039;ll probably hold out on the CPU and GPU hoping the release of Zen, Vega and the 1080ti will give me better deals.
is mini itx a meme? I&#039;m building a new pc and hate how heavy and how much space my current PC takes, but it&#039;s also already hard enough to build as it is with a full tower. How hard it is to build a mini atx pc? I imagine everything is cramped as fuck, and the case cables to the mobo are a fucking nightmare to plug in.
Help /g/, I&#039;m &quot;upgrading&quot; (really building a new pc and rehashing some of the parts that aren&#039;t outdated from my current pc), I got a gtx 1060 and I have an FX 8350, want to switch to intel.Will an i7 be overkill? What can I get that performs better than the FX 8350 and will go nice with the gtx 1060?

what the fuck happened? remember when &quot;just get more ram, it&#039;s cheap&quot; was a thing? Why did the prices skyrocket?
DDR4
.
What does /g/ think?

Phones need RAM too.
Get out you retarded pleb.

Not sure yet about which 1070 I&#039;m gonna get.
Also, just use PCP, it&#039;s there for a reason.
H E L PIs this a good choice?
Coolermaster T4 or 212 Evo, you&#039;re not gonna find a Noctua worth owning in that pricerange.
fuck phones desu
How can I improve it with the same money or even less?
Are you aware of the fact that you don&#039;t have a dedicated GPU in your build?
FUCK, my bad
I don&#039;t play gay men, it&#039;s fine.
Anything else to improve it?
What are you planning to do with it?
Unless you know you need the i5
I&#039;ve got a 212 evo currently, it&#039;s whining starting from 40% power.

Total: 49€
Nice job, faggot.
Thx will look into the cpu cooler tomorrow
Browsing, 4k youtube, music, photoshop, occasionally play old games, web design, some audio editing.
You&#039;ll probably get away plenty with a cheaper MB and an i3-6100.
I&#039;m not a really experienced, but is this gonna be ok?
Good cooler, similar to the 212 Evo. If you&#039;re german, which i guess because of the PCGH cooler, take at look at their reviews.
Close, I&#039;m a dutchy. Thx, I will.
Current onboard GPU should be fine for watching 4k. Photoshop doesn&#039;t require a GPU, but it helps a lot with many features. I suggest getting an i3 and invest the saved money into a RX 460 or something.
I really want an amd cpu and gpu combo to troll my m8s.Which ones should I take for a $700 build?
How does my build look? I&#039;ll be playing at 1080p/144hz.
nothing can go wrong/10
While we are on the topic I&#039;ll post the pc I&#039;m building, I have no knowledge of this stuff as it&#039;s the first time I&#039;m building a pc.I mainly want to know if I need to get additional parts like fans or something.And yes, I have money, otherwise I wouldn&#039;t have chosen the parts
V

A 2TB HDD is cheaper than two 1TB HDDs. Do you really need that MB and memecooler if you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re doing? You can probably save a hundred bucks going for an aircooler and an ASUS Z170-A and still get the same performance.
Get a better keyboard, and teach yourself how to make a custom loop. If you&#039;re set on a 1080, go with Zotac or PNY.
No shit, it includes an overpriced gayming monitor, keyboard and speakers.
someone on here told me 2 terabyte drives have a higher failure rate so he suggested I got 2 one terabyte drives
That guy is an idiot, don&#039;t do it.
if you guys could suggest me a better keyboard that&#039;s a better or similar price please let me know, also if you can find me a 144hz 1440p monitor better than this one let me know, like I said I am new to this
Your cooler IS a water cooler. How could you NOT have known this?
so if I have a water cooler what&#039;s the issue? I&#039;ve heard good things about my cooler
Pic highly related
Alright thanks for the constructive feedback, it really helped me out
On the other hand, a normal heatsink with a fan has nothing that could go wrong, no liquid that could leak, no pump to fail. The only thing that can possibly break is the fan, which is easy and cheap to replace. Air coolers are usually a lot quieter and cheaper at the same performance.
The Masterliquid Pro 240 in this image has two 120mm fans, just like the model in your build.
Do you mind linking me a good air cooler?
He&#039;s right, you know? You should just get a prebuilt system and use it to educate yourself. The information you need is on google and youtube. We&#039;re not gonna waste out time researching for you.
cooler
Hell, you don&#039;t even know what AIO is. Prebuilt systems exist for a reason and it&#039;s no shame to buy one if you have no clue, which is the case for you.
Ok but I&#039;m choosing to make my own pc and it seems I have a fairly good build minus the cooler, so it&#039;s not a waste of parts, you guys said my keyboard, speakers, monitor, hard drives are shit but never said why, so I assume it&#039;s because they aren&#039;t dirt cheap, most people on this board are poorfag neets anyways
At least we know how to assemble computers and which parts to pick.
I already stated numerous times I am not a computer genius so you don&#039;t need to state that irrelevant shit over and over
I&#039;d be curious to see what that build would look like without the help of the compatibility filter.
pls help
And stop using words you don&#039;t know the meaning of.
Anyways.. do whatever you want with your dads money since it seems he agreed on your precious (((GAMING RIG))) present for christmas.
Name one misuse of a word because I guarantee you are 5 years younger than me at least, that&#039;s why you all have no money and get mad whenever someone with a job buys expensive parts
Just fuck off already and buy something already assembled for your rich highness&#039; convenience instead of shitting up this thread with whining about nobody wanting to spoonfeed you.
H
Not enough LEDs, you fokin pleb.
The Noctua NH-D14/15, Cryorig H7 or be quiet! Dark Rock Pro 3 are good options if you want to spend a little more than &#039;budget&#039; tier for good acoustics.
That case looks like something my 15 year old son would want.
thanks I will check out the noctua, and yeah about the hard drive some misinformed idiot told me that 2tb cards and 3tb cards have a high failure rate, it could be true but he was probably exaggerating quite a bit
I don&#039;t really feel like building a pc and want to just buy a refurbed desktop and upgrade it. wut do
J
Is it worth picking up a Fury now, or should I just get a 1070/wait for Vega? I&#039;d like to get a 1440p monitor soon too, and Freesync looks pretty nice.
Entirely depends on how cheap a deal you get on it. It&#039;s an old card and the only one I can find is 350 bucks, for which you can get better alternatives.
I&#039;m very happy with mine but I&#039;m only at 1080p.
So my first PC build fried because I had a bad PSU. I got a new PSU via RMA and I have decided to take another whack at building a PC.N
You could go with a micro ATX MB instead and shove everything in the similar but smaller Air 240, considering you&#039;re opting for that short GPU anyway.
Yeah I have considered the Air 240. As for why it would be too wide, this may sound kind of autistic but I have to transport this PC to a friend&#039;s place to download stuff because my internet is shit, and I live far out in the country.
Seems like a weird case.. you might look into a bench case if you&#039;re already going that wide
I myself have a Corsair Vengeance C70 and the handles come in handy when moving back and forth between two places every once in a while.
phP6/silverstone-case-tj08be
Can&#039;t go wrong with the ammo box.
USA, Web browsing, Downloading, 15khz 240P gaming.
I&#039;d get a G4400 instead, it&#039;s just a couple bucks more. I&#039;m not up to date on the Intel HD graphic 510, but it should make the 6670 obsolete.
Anyone have a preference for M.2 SSDs?
crucial mx300 is what I have, seems fine and has an extra 24-45gb over the other guys.
What sort of M.2? The fast ones, or the cheap ones?
Just one that is good. I am kind of biased towards samsung but I just wanted to know if there are any better ones out there
Samsung&#039;s the best right now. There isn&#039;t a contest because Samsung has a monopoly on good SSD components which lets them sell powerful SSDs cheaper than their competitors.
Everything else you can disregard.
are you planning on going multi-gpu or something tho? because 850w seems like overkill. it seems like that&#039;d take up 650w at most
Should I upgrade?H
Why would you get 2 980tis at this point in time? If it&#039;s the hybrid cooling you&#039;re a retard.
I&#039;ll probably throw out the older AIO for a newer one.
What&#039;s the ETA on Vega? I&#039;d heard Q1, but that might have just been for Zen.
Q1 is Ryzen.
The only restriction is that you get one PCIE slot for one card (you probably are doing that), and that you also are limited to maybe four storage drives. Some cases even allow for dual CPU water coolers.
250d is basically a 380t with a CD drive
One last look through before I buy itAlready have the drives, thanks
If you ever want to overclock, simply replace CPU and buy an aftermarket cooler.
Just going to go with mine
Better investment IMO.
With i5 6400 (or even 6500) what chipset shoud I pick?Or maybe I should I go for h170 stuff?
Period.
Don&#039;t really need to overclock a nas
H110 is all you really need if you&#039;re just gaming on a locked Intel. H170 is if you actually need more PCIe Gen3.0 lanes for other add-in cards.
I mean there are tons ov videos with 6400 oc&#039;d over 4GHz running in cinebench, but there&#039;s literally no in game testing results.

No thanks.
It&#039;s enough of a hassle now that it&#039;s actually cheaper just to buy an entry-level Z170 board and a 6600K.
Recently bought this to be used as a low-power consuming virtual host running ESXi.My goal was to go fairly cheap, which is why I opted for AMD processor because more cores for less bucks.
You know, Core i3s come in T SKUs that top out at 35Ws AND have ECC compatibility. Even a Core i3-6100T will run circles around that Steamroller APU.
Came out to ~$290 on black friday
http://www.lian-li.com/en/dt_portfoAnyone have this?
holy fug where do you do your shopping on brack fridy
I just low balled a bunch of people on ebay selling haswell i3&#039;s until I got one and the rest was a combination of Newegg, B&amp;H photo, and Jet
2011-3 + i7 6800K it is.
2costly4me.
You may need a Z170 board anyways.
Shit&#039;s tight.
underrated post
yeah reminds me to ask, what processor do consoles like PS4 and xbox1 actually have?
Looking to upgrade a really old pc with some cheapo parts for resell later. Only has a 300 watt psu though and no 6 pin connector btw.
Both use a custom AMD x86_64 SoC
GHz?
Very similar to the video game consoles people assemble in this thread - /vgcag/
want some help with the last part of my buildCan go a little over if there&#039;s a far superior product just outside that range.
Maybe see if Creative has something that works for you. You could also get some used studio monitors if your PC has optical output.
How do I find out what load my computer is usually at, in terms of power consumption? I&#039;m looking for a PSU that stays in passive mode below a certain load threshold and don&#039;t want to end up with one that spins the fan anyway because it only works below 150W and my PC uses 160W in &quot;idle&quot;. I know the theoretical idle load, but I want a more realistic estimate, any software that let&#039;s me monitor this?I&#039;ve been looking at the corsair RM650, are there better alternatives? The corsair fans that came with my case were loud and weak, are the PSU fans loud aswell?
What the fuck.
I have an MMO client running at all times, so &quot;idle&quot; isn&#039;t really idle. That&#039;s why I want to measure it in the first place.
Why is it that when someone will put, say, a 1T ssd into their PC, it will only show like 986gb of storage? I&#039;ve found that almost any HDD and ssd I&#039;ve seen does this.
b = bit or barn, depending on context.

1KB isn&#039;t 1000 bytes.
1 KiB = 1024 Byte.
How likely am i to get by on 4gb of ram? not looking to do any extreme stuff.also now that  i think about it, how good is intel 520 graphics? not for gaming but for lets say slight photoshop and 1080p video
Good enough. You only really need a video card if you&#039;re either running more than a few monitors, play moderately demanding games at 720p or higher, or need hardware acceleration for rendering.
70---What-is-the-Difference-635/
Building a PC, mainly gonna use it for light gaming, nothing like photo editing or anything like that. I know there aren&#039;t too many things that take advantage of it right now, I&#039;m more curious what you&#039;d do.
I have a Z97, X99 and C236 system at home because I actually use almost all of the features they support. Hell, I even had to upgrade to an X99 board because I ran out of PCIe lanes.
Is Xeon the only decent CPU family left? The rest are just worthless shit, right?
Give me a budget and what you actually need and I&#039;ll give you a barebones parts list
2 1080p monitors, zero gaming. bit of vegas, photoshop and hi def vid. main purpose is home  business. was considering a i5 6500 and possibly a radeon 460
An i7-6700 (non-K) would meet your needs quite well, but an i5-6500 will do, if a bit slower. I don&#039;t like using hardware acceleration, but using an Nvidia card can speed up any video encoding software that uses NVENC
that $200 aud price difference though. would it really beat  out a 6500+460 (slightly cheaper option)
For Photoshop, an i7 will flat out beat an i5, but only by a small amount that&#039;s hard to justify its $100+ price tag. I&#039;d say play it safe and get an i5 with a GPU that&#039;s capable of H.265 encoding, preferably with 10-bit color output (which is only found on Quadro and FirePro cards for now).
If you want a mobo with 4 RAM slots there&#039;s the cheap MSI B150 Pro-VDH for $65. All price differences are marginal if you want an entry H110/B150, so why not get the later?
jeez, i thought stuff like the 7970 had 10bit out for some reason. are you saying though that im looking at the wrong types ofr graphics cards by buy what i guess is gamer stuff?
Get cancer and die.
Just trying to determine CPU.
I think GCN does technically support 10-bit color output, nut not for encoding or rendering work. That&#039;s firmly in the FirePro and Quadro market, so even if you can output raw videos to 10-bit with a bit of BIOS fiddling, the post-production videos using GPU acceleration will not be in 10-bit color.
It only get&#039;s stupid when some retard who never touched a computer part before wants to buy a (((gaming rig))) for $3k.
Can&#039;t fight the literal trips of truth, faggot. You will get cancer one day.
worse is z and k then never ocing it. reminds me i should oc my 8350
Good chip if only it wouldn&#039;t need a nuclear reactor to power it or require liquid nitrogen cooling to not nuke the entire planet.
got a 212 evo and 760w psu. no complaints but my power bill. i dont get why people still buy it
I want a cool, quiet, decently performant and energy efficient system. Hopefully AMD will deliver in Q1 2017. The market needs competition.
it5 certainly was 4 years ago when i built it, best bang for your buck. man i hope zen delivers at a good wattage
I currently use an fx4100 with an asrock motherboard. I could buy an lga1155 motherboard and an i5 3550 for like $140 used on ebay. Is it worth it?
Nah. Save your money for a bigger upgrade.
I&#039;ve done the research but I want to make sure that my logic is correct.
Looks good if the 212 Evo fits inside the case.
The 212 EVO is good, but clearly isn&#039;t the best choice for OC, see if you can fit something like a Noctua NH-U12/14S in there.
Cheers on the PSU rec.
To me it sounds that all you&#039;d probably need is a i5-6500 build. Rethink if you really want to spend that money or not.
This part I do keep mulling over, since I&#039;d also save on the cooler.
Actually my first time posting on /g/, hoping i&#039;m not a complete moron here, Was thinking of upgrading to a 1070, but is my cpu getting outdated? I honestly don&#039;t really know
You could save on everything. What&#039;s the purpose of this build, gaming, work, shitposting?
Don&#039;t fall for the &quot;you don&#039;t need more&quot; meme if you have the money to future proof your system. Although I also have to say the price difference between the 6500 and the 6600 is too much for the performance gain.
CPUs have barely aged since 2011 so i wouldn&#039;t worry about that. Upgrade your GPU if anything.
I&#039;m fully aware that I&#039;m paying extra for the form factor, but that part I am actually not willing to compromise. Literally my only consideration is whether or not to OC and just get a 6500, which would mean I don&#039;t have to get that expensive mobo and cooler.
alright, is there anything cpu-wise that would be a big performance increase over what I have, that&#039;s like, budget-tier? if you can think of something off the top of your head.
If you&#039;re willing to compromise ITX for mATX you could save money, too.
It&#039;s the best LGA1155 CPU you could have. Upgrading the CPU would mean upgrading to Skylake, getting a CPU, MB and RAM.
thanks
that actually makes me feel great considering I bought my pc prebuilt like.. 5 years ago
Is there anything I should change in my gaming build?
If you really want to OC, no, otherwise, yes.
LED fans, it&#039;s not really a gaymen PC without some. I&#039;ve found that LED fans add about 5 fps each and monster or razer stickers add 2 fps.
Overkill eurofag NAS/homeserver:Something that I have grossly overlooked?
No reason to buy something you shouldn&#039;t use, and if you actually need an i7 now, either your use case changed or you didn&#039;t plan properly
What are your electricity rates like? Because the Xeon E3-1260L v5 Turbos up to a higher boost frequency as the 1225, but uses half the power most of the time.
I have $350 (usd) and I want to build a itx machine on a itx sized test bench for the smallest build possible. What do? I have considered used haswell parts but I feel like there should be a better solution.

Oh shit I meant for the Mobo and the CPU. I have all the other stuff from my current pc.
That is a mobo and CPU
honestly great to hear, was probably going to get a 1070, that way I&#039;m set for the future as well, I don&#039;t have a 1440p monitor but am probably going to get one soonish
Of course, the E8500 is still a great CPU aswell. But I could&#039;ve gotten an even greater CPU, had I known I&#039;d need it someday. I absolutely wouldn&#039;t have missed the money back then, now I&#039;m spending more overall by upgrading.
Is there any reason to go with Haswell instead of Skylake besides &quot;muh botnet&quot;?
not sure if they are priced in your range though
Can you recommend me a good 140mm static pressure fan for my rig? I want to create an even more effective wind tunnel in my case (pic related) than I already have, by placing a decent fan in the front, so I can get rid of all the fans on the CPU heat sink itself. I don&#039;t know if that will work at all, but it&#039;s worth a try.
What&#039;s the fan on the front? It&#039;s best to get the same exhaust fan as the front. Ideally, you&#039;d get the higher static pressure rating fan in the front and a quasi-static pressure fan at the rear that pushes about 80% of the air as the front.
Can&#039;t get the same. The back fits 120mm only, the front fits 140. I don&#039;t want to downsize the front fan. A positive pressure is preferred anyway, and the side panel has a mesh.
Which one? I clicked through some models and found the supernova 650 GS, which is only passive under 25% load. As I said above, I have an MMO client running in the background at all times, which could very well put my idle at more than 160W. The 750 version however doesn&#039;t specify maximum load for passive cooling at all, it just ambiguoulsy says &quot;zero fan noise during low load operations&quot;.
If that&#039;s the case, what&#039;s the rear fan? A Fractal Design Dynamic GP-12 or Silent R3?
For what reason?
Why is the back fan important? It just sucks air out. Any particular airflow characteristics a fan might have are only applicable for blowing, not sucking, except the CFM for obvious reasons.
I&#039;m asking because I want to know its rated CFM. If you don&#039;t know, buy a Fractal Design Venturi or Phanteks PH-F140HP
Less fans, quieter PC, little more temp (can take it, I have a pretty large headroom).
You said you want an effective wind tunnel, now you say you want a quiet PC.
A bunch of low RPM fans are more quiet than one doing all the work. No case airflow will ever be more quiet at the same cooling performance than a triple fan NH-D15.
I have a personal grudge against PC noise, because 18 months of 24/7 (literally, I work from home) buzzing at 32 decibels in my ear got me hearing impaired, and music was like the only fucking joy I had in this miserable life as a paraplegic. Now I&#039;m literally wearing earplugs all the time, while I&#039;m rationing my fucking music listening to a couple of hours a week, while I can still hear anything at 16 KHz and below, with tinnitus fucking up the silent parts.
I guess you&#039;re just in love with the idea of not having fans mounted to your heatsink. Put the heatsink fans on the front of the case to make your PC quieter. I really can&#039;t quite grasp what you&#039;re asking here.
Whatever...
RX 480 8 GB or GTX 1070 for 1080p 144hz?
do i need to install my cpu cooler when doing an out of box test boot?
You should at least have a heatsink installed whenever you power up your CPU.
If you don&#039;t, it goes from 0-100 faster than your car. If you want to turn it on, you have to install cooling first. Period.
ok, thanks. my cooler is huge though (pic related) and i don&#039;t have a stock one i can use for a test boot. should i even try installing this thing outside the case?
7700k uses shit thermal interface material - delidding decreases temperatures by as much as 33C (from 99C to 66C).Reminder that Intel hates overclockers because they&#039;d rather have you pay 2x more for the performance you could get free from overclocking.
Enjoy your voided warranty
Apparently you can just glue it back for RMA and they are fine with it.
Intel and Apple are basically family in the sense that all their products are memes, are overproduced, and are highly overpriced, yet people still buy themhopefully Ryzen is as good as it seems
Intel is a monopoly, not a meme.
WHEN&#039;S THE PRICEDROP INTEL.Kaby lake is Skylake. Ryzen is ready to fuck you in the ass.  Drop the goddamn prices already so I can upgrade.
its like you enjoy bdsm or something
It isn&#039;t even the first time, they&#039;ve been at it since Ivy Bridge.

No wonder ryzen was able to run at a lower temp despite their fab process being slightly worse.
The TIM intel uses isn&#039;t great, but it isn&#039;t the cause of the problem. Its shim height. For whatever reason intel simply doesn&#039;t have the IHS pressed down far enough to make good contact with the die. Its unknown why this is, but it is known that it is explicitly intentional, and they have maintained this over several generations of chips now.
That&#039;s even more crooked
Sabotaging your own product, including mobile parts, makes no sense. Though intel matter of factly is doing just that. Theres no way to explain this away.
The K line chips are just purposefully gimped so they can&#039;t overclock as high.
Ryzen is matching Kaby right now right? Wonder if that changes with better TIM.
A non soldered IHS isn&#039;t an issue if done right, the difference in thermal transfer is paltry.
You have to buy a warranty for K parts
But being careful it should work right?
pls explain
beep beep beep beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
&gt;&gt;&gt;/leave/
Man shit like this doesn&#039;t surprise me anymore. That&#039;s why I&#039;m waiting for zen instead.
rude
In any case buying a CPU now is stupid, wait for Ryzen and see what it brings to the table, then decide what to buy.
Hopefully Zen won&#039;t be a complete farce like kabby lake has been.
If zen is actually good intel might try to make a successor to sandy bridge.
wow it runs hot at 5.1ghz
Nope.
99C with default TIM and 66C with liquid metal TIM is a paltry difference to you? With solder, the temps would be even lower...
But with liquid cooling and a custom shim, you probably could it.
I have a 300-400 dollar budget for a microphone set up. What do I buy?Usage will be for games, conference calls, and skype.

Just buy a decent quality usb mic and if you have to be a sperglord a mic boom.
for voice chat with friends and basic streaming i use a 13 dollar chink usb desk mic works fine m8. spend the other 375$ on hookers and blow.
You don&#039;t have enough in your budget . You need to save at least 5 grand and get a vintage ribbon mic

that&#039;s a no.
they work as long as you&#039;re not going todo any resource intensive work on thembut they won&#039;t give you prestige like macbooks or thinkpads or those sexy aluminum ultrabooks
and the build quality is shit but if you need them for a couple of years they&#039;re alright
Im searching for a great cost/benefit notebook, not something expensive or too cheap
I have a Acer Alpha Switch 12.  works well and isn&#039;t shitty so far.  Battery life sucks though but no worries.  Bloatware is a thing but nothing a reinstall of the OS can&#039;t fix.

The Predator gives you the autismo level that breaks through the dimension barrier.
Thoughts on this?Geforce 940M
But I also used it heavily like 12h per day everyday and had many thermal shutdown

Not a huge fan of the build quality, but the Aspire 5560G I recommended for my bro in law is still going strong 4+ years later. Fine for lighter users I guess.

Good old jade

ever met an actuary? or the teams working at banks doing the heavy computer work? or gone to any cs lab? leave your apple bubble for a day maybe?
my family used to love buying those. They always break (and I don&#039;t mean just &quot;their windows got full of malware&quot; but hardware stuff too). Don&#039;t buy them.
my last year asus is all right, but the keyboard is kind of flimsy and the plastic on the back gets rekt easily and starts to look like shit.
Why is the jade logo upside-down? Is this a meme?
recently you could build a quad core i5 with a 960m on HP&#039;s website for $649. was gonna get one but had to fix my car instead.

So..... Thoughts on Asus?
What about HP?
What happened to Fujitsu-Siemens laptops?
this is a ruse
they used to make neat netbooks.
I like ASUS netbooks.
now that all laptops are thin as fuck i bet they&#039;re a major pain in the ass to rebuild. the inch thick ones are usually pretty easy after you&#039;ve done a few.
Acer, even if considered to be bad by /g/, are the best out of the 3 big cheap brands (HP, Lenovo, Acer)
I have an Acer laptop I have had now, for going on 5 years. I have had to replace 3 keyboards, a touchpad. Now the hinge that hold the screen on broke off at the bottom, so I need to replace the entire bottom of the laptop. That cause the casing that holds the screen in place to start to separate. I had given up on using it as a &quot; laptop &quot;, so I just put it on a table and hooked a mouse and keyboard up to it, then the power connector took a shit. The laptop itself is plenty fast still. I put a Samsung 840 Pro SSD in it and maxed the ram out. It runs good, when it runs. But the build quality is less than fantastic, that&#039;s for damn sure. Especially how expensive it was at the time ( I think it was around 800 bucks ).
yes
I personally am thinking of getting a Thinkpad 13 for 400 buckerinos, but I&#039;m not sure. It seems like a good deal.
For *5* years that&#039;s pretty fucking good
I had an HP EliteBook for 7 years and the hard drive just failed two days ago. I can throw in an SSD and keep going.

i&#039;m getting another laptop by acer though ;). i mean i&#039;ve had shit and good laptops by the same company before so sḿh tbħ
It&#039;s ok, build quality /design is mediocre but it&#039;s cheap and as long as you take care of your laptop, it shouldn&#039;t break that easily
Buy a Lenovo IdeaPad
Confined to the nipponese market
buy laptop on specs and price, not brand.brand doesn&#039;t really matter if the specs aren&#039;t right.
In a word, no.
Is this a good desktop? Planning on using it for emulation and maybe some gaming. But in the future I&#039;ll ad a rx 480 or 490 and upgrade the ram.
A decent skeleton, I&#039;d look for a cheap SSD for the OS if you can.
Lenovo is okay. I own a y50 and upgraded it&#039;s RAM and storage. Battery is replaceable but you need screwdrivers to do so. The keyboard is mediocre and a clean install is mandatory. Other models should be decent. The y50-70 have a bit too much of the gamer looks, giving me a bit of buyers remorse but I got it fairly cheap.
Most cheapser ones like all acers compleately break apart at the hinges or get technical problems, why the fuck would you buy that trash

Simplicity to shorten the amount of boilerplate code needed.

Buy a Arduino board with an Atmega 32u4 (about $3 on Aliexpress) which has an hardware USB controller unlike the usual Arduinos which have a USB to UART converter chip on the board or get an Digitspark if you just need 2 or 3 buttons (about $1 from China). I built something like this to control some things with my feet while playing cs:go.
Some anon bought the cheap ones. Material was comparable to plastic trash bag
Thank you for the confirmation, though
Oh well thanks m8
how long did It took for them to arrive and where you bough them?
Ordered tablet from gearbest, had been out of stock for a while, but turned to &quot;Packed&quot; today. Paid for expedited DHL shipping, (to UK from China Warehouse) what are the chances of it coming before Christmas?
-0.5
They piss around with it even after they mark it shipped but DHL are excellent

REEEEEEEE ANSWER MY QUESTION HOW MUCH DOES RESOLUTION MATTER FOR AN EREADER
Is 300ppi worth an extra 80 dollars?
STOP!Unless you tell Wacky Jacky what the current memes are you will be cursed with slower shipping times and great chinkings!
$80? No, but the price difference on those is $3
A kobo glo hd (300ppi) is 100+, a kobo glo (213ppi)

/g/ Whats the comfiest pair of headphones you ever owned, I&#039;m looking for a new pair.
akg k70x hands down for me. The don&#039;t pinch, they&#039;re soft and very light.
K702?
I is that Gillian Anderson? I don&#039;t come to /g/ to fap!
All closed headphones are disqualified because no matter what they&#039;re going to heat up and turn your earwax into liquid. Unless someone makes one where you can press a button and vent it with tiny built in fans for a few seconds. Never seen one like that though.Koss KSC75
No, the k70x is an actual headphone.  The x is part of the name
these when they made them 10 years agoshit build though

I haven&#039;t tried a lot of different types, but I really like my AKG K712.

Who would win in a hacking competition?Reddits best hackers or 4chans best hackers?
9gag
Did that kid die or no?
text based communities are more used to seeing text, so their hacking skills are buffed
Reddit has much more users, no? I imagine them as a bunch of Pajeets.
pick one, they&#039;re mostly just fat video gaymers
Well, /g/ is bunch of fat codemonkeys; nobody would have advantage.
Honestly I would have to say reddit.4chan is full of NEET chinese-cartoon watching shitters that dropped out of college with no qualifications whereas reddit is full of normies with real jobs and shit.
The best hacker on 4chan would have penetrated the router and flushed the ip&#039;s before the best reddit hacker would even have gotten through the firewall.
Doesn&#039;t matter, the russians would hack the competition to show that reddit&#039;s hackers were cheating, biasing the judges towards 4chan, and so they would demand that reddit would win because the entire competition was biased.
Neither.
The Hacker named 4chan would win.WHO IS THIS 4CHAN?
What is this from?
Implying their not the same users.And you may as well lump voat in there too now.
some italian kid in &#039;merica pulled out knfies in school and got shot by security guy
he will live all his life with having had lead in his neck
Well considering how normal it is for 4chan to beat Reddit at most things I would imagine the trend would continue
vid?
Underrated
/pol/cucks will see it as a &quot;le innocent white boi who didn&#039;t do nuffin and gets bullied by evil minorities&quot; but the kid is a piece of shit as well who only attended the school in the last 2 weeks since he was in Juvenile hall for robbery/assault
What parts of reddit are even good at hacking?
Reddit has way more people. kek, the same person would probably be the best on both sides.
reddit

Reddit obviously you tard. Still don&#039;t go on that website though.
Sempai, how do I break a firewall?
reddit, of course.  4chan is mostly for angry misfits who don&#039;t have the social support necessary for higher levels of learning.  Most people on /g/ are satisfied that they can solve fizzbuzz and stop there.

feel ya bro..
Check out this photoshoped vershon of that photo
Are we still doing the thing where we pretend 90℅ of us aren&#039;t Reddit users as well?
4chan would win. Reddit is filled with beanie-wearing college programmers. This place is filled with absolute autism and discussing which piece of code is 0.00000000001 seconds faster on the compiler.
Actually pol majority thinks he&#039;s a non-white shit head.
lainchan
We had RMS for while but he probably doesnt countIf you want hack 4chan user just pay hiro for data
Guys I&#039;m literally shaking right now.
Seriously, someone link the video
4chan because you have me on your side
Pffft, not in your lifetime, kid. Maybe one day the AI programs of the future will figure it out though. And then after trillions of years, one day before the universe runs out of energy, the triple integral.
Whoever wins, we lose
Reddit.Try talking to people from 4chan outside of 4chan for once, OP. They&#039;re a wild blend.
They&#039;re probably the same people.
There&#039;s no difference between the two sites except redditors visiting here go overboard with the rude words because they can&#039;t get downvoted for saying naughty things.
Ftfy
Well, I&#039;m an accredditted hacker next week and go to both, so tie?
if you had seen the threads about this on /pol/ you would know most of the racists over there resorted to saying he&#039;s no better than an &#039;n-word&#039; and that he deserved to die
4chanAll those Russians from /int/ would rape reddit
as a ledditor in public (reddit is easier to browse on the bus/at school than 4chan), both sites have those people

I&#039;ll give that a shot later but I want to get the vanilla experience first to have something to compare to. What are some apps every android phone needs? My old phone was a 5 year old WP (great phone btw) and before that I owned a 6 year old symbian s60 phone so I have no fucking idea.
Return it and order a Xiaomi™ Redmi Note 3 Pro
miui is gay
Better mi4c and put RR Nougat on it &lt;3
why would you buy a phone that will be rendered obsolete and left without updates after a year?

Return it and get the Moto Z Play
Do the things you intended to use it for. If you bought it without a need for it then kill yourself.

Install Amaze or ES 3 and browse your files while the itoddlers die of envy in your local starbucks.
You do realize only extremely mentally ill people (ie homosexuals) use iphones, right?

I have to say this android OS is fucking garbage compared to WP.I need it to receive phonecalls and use the web browser when I&#039;m not at home. That doesn&#039;t mean I wouldn&#039;t be interested in other possible applications or easy of use upgrades.

I owned a macbook pro back when they were good. pre-unibody MBP was a good product. Iphone isn&#039;t. Being the same brand doesn&#039;t make any difference.
Tbh, CyanogenMod is closer to stock Android than OxygenOS is.

it appears that windows phone - the OS with no apps - had a much superior youtube app than anything for android. how the fuck is that possible when there wasn&#039;t even competition and it hadn&#039;t updated in years and was made by one russian guy?
i haven&#039;t used android for years now, is it still impossible to play youtube videos in the background with the official app?
I don&#039;t even care about #1 but even #2 and #3 together seem to be an impossibility for android developers.

Windows Fag GTFO. This thread is only for POWER USERS!
rip in peace
Why are you so retarded?
fpbp
You are envy because you lack the brain power to install a Arch and have FULL control over your OS.
I&#039;ve installed it before. No envy. Just wondering what the reason is why OP is so retarded. Ate lead paint as a child maybe?
Why don&#039;t you just admit you are NOT a power user? I actually know how my computer works.
I choose to use Manjaro as my main OS instead of Arch because I use my computer for work, and don&#039;t have time to sink into manually installing everything like an autist.
what is your favorite anime? how many dragon dildos do you own? and lastly how feminine is your penis?
How the fuck do I boot from USBhttps://youtu.be/VFH83FmI0os
Because you don&#039;t know how your system works. Arch is the most stable distro. I use it in all my servers.
How many pills do you take per day?
have you tried not using uefi, jake?
What do I use then
I&#039;m a real man. The only pill I ever took was the redpill.
gentoo gives you even more control
Use the first option in the second column, you pen drive&#039;s name without &quot;UEFI&quot;.
DELETE THIS
Why didn&#039;t you build LFS instead? Not smart enough?
Thank you I will try that
Arch is the superior OS for power users.
Arch is no more stable than the other reputable distros, so you&#039;re also a biased retard. In conclusion, you are very similar to about 90% of the people on this forum. Once again, congrats. I bet you actually thought you were a special snowflake for doing what 9/10 people on this forum have done before you.
plebians
I also would like to know this, how far can you insert your dragon dildo into your anus OP?
How much do you resent systemd?
gee, it sounds fun
NOOBUNTUS ON SUICIDE WATCH
Woah woah woah hold on pardner summer is pretty far off.
I&#039;ll tell you what slackware ever did: Bitch and moan about systemd - because bitching and moaning is ONLY what Slackware is good for. It&#039;s pathetic and has a negative effect on the community.

I think we should completely exile them, they can move to BSD or some other garbage.
How do you configure wired network?

Takes like 30 minutes, tops.
In what ways? You have less control over your system.

Just wrong.
sorry your childish mind can&#039;t comprehend the fact that just because a distro only distributes software doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s bad.
You are right. I will sell all of my existing equipment and go buy an Apple computer that looks like a trash can. Thanks for helping me realize that Linux has too many buttons and I need to pay people to make computer.

What brain power? You just followed the fucking installation manual retard. Don&#039;t talk like you accomplished something.
Its nice
Is this the neo neofetch thread?
Why do you voluntarily get raped by cuck devs?
6 minutes and 5 seconds here on an i3, he is just retarded.
Secondly, that dev is the cuck. Systemd is glorious.
That mailing list isn&#039;t  really that much about systemd. It&#039;s about how Arch doesn&#039;t split packages, have &quot;alternatives&quot; (xbps-alternatives, update-alternatives, ecletic, eselect).  It&#039;s about how there is no voting system like in Debian, no **supported** or **guranteed to work** option to say change /usr/bin/python to python2.7 or /bin/sh to /bin/dash.
TOP KEK
I haven&#039;t used Arch in about 4 years. What&#039;s new? Do they have atomic updates yet?
I did not. I installed and configured it all by myself.
How long have you lived in your moms basement?
Arch users are fucking retarded lmfao

Also what fatal system errors were you getting? Not fatal but a lot of times Ubuntu will popup an error box if you fucked with the package manager but usually it can be fixed with a simple sudo apt-get install -f or sudo dpkg --configure -a
Install gentoo
Also sometimes you have to clear the crash log to get those error boxes to stop popping up. sudo rm /var/crash/*
The earlier fatal errors had to do with the Unity or whatever GUI interface and an incompatibility with my old shit hardware.
No thanks I have pretty good looks and social skills :)
Sounds plausible considering you said you used multiple torrent clients. The different clients could have been changing the partially downloaded files timestamp and when you started a new client it didn&#039;t match, causing an a mismatch between what the client had saved and what it remembered the file as. Maybe try uninstalling the clients you don&#039;t need and just having 1 to make it simpler.
I guess I am more at fault for a lot of this than I thought. It&#039;s a little frustrating because now I made this tangled mess of my apt-get with all these shitty faulty dependencies. Will  sudo apt-get install -f  fix  that up?
Yeah, you might have to uninstall the packages causing it though too. I think it prompts you for that. (blabla expects xxx but xxx installed, uninstall xxx?)
Use transmission-daemon. Mount your data file system as a user by configuring /etc/fstab, that will probably fix your samba problem.
When did women stop wearing low cut shirts?
At this point, I think you&#039;re better off backing /home and reinstalling.
Welp.
sudo dpkg --configure -a
When you have no purpose in life you create artificial problems to fill the void. This is an accurate description of every Linux user I&#039;ve ever met - very depressing people, often rude and blaming the world for their own mistakes.

what was the point of this post you retarded retard
Don&#039;t get this the wrong way, but when I read your posts I feel like I&#039;m losing brain cells. Anyway, lovely conversation keep it up son.
I don&#039;t think you&#039;ve read the thread, he installed packages from unknown sources, copy-pasted commands into the terminal and blindly followed guides to configure things. He *can* reverse what he&#039;s done but it&#039;s gonna take a long time. Reinstalling will be quicker and easier.

malwarebytes
literally biggest scam in software industry
we have it for free at work and company gave me a license for home as well. It&#039;s the shit. Others don&#039;t catch as much shit as Kaspersky does.
I use McAfee for 5 years now and it&#039;s the best antivirus on the market. It always saves my PC when it gets infected.
Jesus christ what the fuck how incompetent can you be?
sqeeeeeek
CS 2017 Pro Edition + MBAM
Isnt kaspersky the one that literally opens a backdoor in your computer?
Shouldn&#039;t the AV prevent you from being infected?

I have it, I had outpost  firewall but they were bought out by kaspersky. Their firewall is ok though outpost was better. Not sure about AV, its on but never had any alerts, not sure if its a good thing or bad thing.
If you seriously feel the need to use an AV the only good one is ESET and that&#039;s a fact.
If you&#039;re fine with joining the Russian botnet, by all means.
They also regularly make malware to cripple their competitor&#039;s products.

What does kav have to do with avg? Are you retarded?
shiggy

UNIX is the best antivirus
I&#039;m buying Kaspersky for my parents every year.The 3 license pack is like 15€/year, so 5€ for each PC
AntiVirus programs are memes. I even disabled Windows Defender since it impacts performance.

If you&#039;re retarded enough to get infected on Windows you will just as likely get infected on Linux.. especially if you use shit like the AUR etc.. I see many people unconcernlingly using &quot;yaourt -S x&quot; without even checking the .pkg etc.
I do the same.

Haven&#039;t used antivirus in like ten years.I used to selectively turn it on to scan no-CD cracks, but now I rarely play or pirate games any more and then I only download torrents that are at least a few months old.

Ask God
Any recommended free anti malware programs? Especially any that let you scan files before downloading them.
Webroot is great b/c low impact
What about bitdefender??
Windows defender/Malwarebytes/Ccleaner
Trust me. I&#039;m a TI consultant.
CommonSense 2017
But anon, wouldn&#039;t you want a second layer of defence?
Would say newest malware bytes with anti exploit (what EMET didn&#039;t fix they did ) but lots of time running antivirus is another attack vector for elevated privs or other ring0 cheeky stuff
Never gotten virus/malware etc. ever. I don&#039;t usually download torrents or random shit and use adblockers on sites. I only whitelist sites I trust. If I can&#039;t view a site I simply don&#039;t use it.
it&#039;s like having a knight in full armor follow you around your house knocking shit over and fucking it up. yeah it can slay a dragon but he just knocked over your flatscreen and crushed your pc and your left foot. oh and installed a lock on one of your rooms and now you can&#039;t get in until he remembers how.
Have they added real-time protection yet?
Nod32. Never had a problem, everything gets burnt to a crisp at a moments notice.
norton 360 because its pretty much free to me
Why arent you using the best operating system known to man?
but I am
Because I don&#039;t want my system to be compromised by a third-party due to no security updates.

No TRIM or DX11.That&#039;s literally it.

Truth be told I don&#039;t even play games that require DX11 but nice memetext all the same.

Then why the fug do you care about DX11?
other than that I agree
posting my desktop
Because I work with Unreal Engine 4 and I prefer to have access to DirectX 12.

What is the best Linux for hardware compatability?
Don&#039;t Ubuntu and Mint configure around your hardware on installation to make sure they just werk on a fresh installation?
Manjaro has an option to install it &quot;non-free&quot; which detects your hardware and uses the best drivers immediately , even on the live CD.

so i have the gayest monitor problem of all-time. I&#039;m a tryhard who loves to play fps games in high framerates all day so I bought a 1440p monitor that runs at 144hz. for the first two months everything was honky dorry, thing ran in 144hz pretty gud. then one day I noticed it kept flashing black random. Eventually the flashing got so bad i could only use the monitor for 2 seconds before it blacked out again. Bought a new cable, problem with the flashing is gone, but now the stupid thing can&#039;t hit 144Hz for some reason. Would only show 60Hz on the refresh rate select. I shit you I had to go into nvidia control panel, make a custom resolution to manually change the Hz. I tried 144 and the whole EVERYTHING on both monitors blacked out, only came back after reboot. So I started pushing a little bit more the next time. 80Hz worked, then 90Hz, then 100Hz, then 110Hz. When I tried 120Hz, same thing that happened with 144Hz: EVERYTHING blacked out, nothing worked, no signal, nada. Wouldn&#039;t even switch back after 20seconds, just fucking gone. The highest I was able to get it to go without blacking out is 115Hz, arbitrary as fuck I know. But for some fucking reason, if I try to push it to 116Hz or 117Hz, again, everything blacks out, have to reboot computer.I don&#039;t even know what the fuck would cause something like this to happen.

Didn&#039;t want to read the wall of text, but did you make sure your monitor itself is set to DisplayPort 1.2 mode rather than 1.1? That&#039;s what I had to do with my Asus 4k one.

Do you agree with this /g/?
I agree with everything but the 90%. Something like 50% would be more accurate for me.
you will still look like a retard no matter what you buy
ZEN WILL BE A 90% IMPROVEMENT UPON THE PREVIOUS GENERATION WITH THE SAME COST!
90% is too high.make it something like 30% and we have a deal.

Give me more ADVERTISING please.
I usually do a CPU upgrade around 50% - 70% improvement, with my last build I went from a 955 BE to a 4790k.
You&#039;d pay 100% of the price for 30% of improvement? That&#039;s crazy man.
what about newer chips that are optimized for specific applications such as neural nets?
Yes
Work on your reading comprehension, friend
I can pay the price of my current cpu for 30% improvement.
Those are for medical use, they are a different topic.
Why?  The price of the old CPU doesn&#039;t matter since you&#039;ve already paid for it.  The question is only whether a 30% improvement is worth $300 to you right now.
Found the poorfag
Good goyim
I&#039;ll upgrade for less.
No, it&#039;s retarded, because measuring relative performance is a meme anyways, and it treats performance quantitatively but cost qualitatively. Instead the equation should be &quot;is the improved performance worth the cost&quot;. Not to mention that the cost of the original CPU is meaningless due to market forces anyway.

At least include ALL other factors that come with upgrading a new CPU - new socket, new mobo, DDR4 vs DDR3, etc.
Have a you
That makes it even more of a compelling argument if you think about it.
fuck you, stupid cunt.
Money increases it&#039;s value over time retard. Ever heard of inflation?
that is deflation desu
Ever heard of Black Friday?
This chart is outdated we will only see those type of gains in decades. It all about the features they can cram in it

Well, I upgraded from a C2 Q6600 to a 4790K, how much improvement was? 200% 300%?
inflation decreases the value of your money, you literal retard
I have an AMD Phenom II X2 1045T which I know can be overclocked to 4.0GHz but right now I keep it at 3.0GHz. I have no reason to upgrade.
Generally you you&#039;d be moving to a much newer platform that can support newer devices.
I paid $260 for my Q6600 and $290 for my 5820k.I&#039;d say I made a good upgrade.
Guess only retards have bought cpus for the last decade.

Why is it that vulgar posters often are so wrong and and proudly boasting their ignorance?
Dunning–Kruger effect
I went from i5-6400 with a gtx 970  to a i7-6700k with a 1080 aero.  In under 1 year.
I&#039;d say the problem is in quantifying improvement.Personally I only buy entire new computers every 5 years or so, because standards.

This guide is retarded.

George RR Martin writes his books with an MS-DOS word processor in 80x25 text mode.
But my Q6600 from 9+ years ago is still going strong
Then don&#039;t upgrade. If you already know that what you have is sufficient then you don&#039;t need a CPU buying guide because you&#039;re not buying a CPU.
GPU is possibly a better investment for NN and other heavy mathematics
I think you mean &quot;absolutely is&quot;.
When you&#039;re this retarded
*triggered*
I have a 1st gen i7.. Running on water @4.0ghz. Sure, it runs fast AND uses a shit ton of power. But I can&#039;t get any of the newer features.
Buying a new CPU is just a waste of money unless you REALLY need it. I have postpone investing in a new CPU many times by rather upgrading the GPU. And then always a newer budget one.   The current setup is 10 years old and still going strong.
only sith deals in absolutes
I reallllly hope you guys realize that he was pointing out that money decreases in value over time thus it is lower than 100% of the price for a 30% increase.
From the old P805D to the 4790k there is a 2000% increase in performance. But the price is at least 2 to 3 times the cost of the 805. Again, no investment will be made unless I really, really need the i7.
also saged
Not buying. My Pentium 805 D + a GeForce GTS 250 runs perfectly fine. The combo has survived several power supplies and monitors. Handles 1080 fine. However, the CPU are not the best handling modern website loading, and their 30+ scrips they typically wants to load.
Guess I&#039;ll stay on an core2duo then.
Now... is that applicable?
easy
a 30% improvement is more than enough reason to upgrade a processor if you actually feel the need to.
Does it have at least 10 times the bogomips (total):don&#039;t buy
i think this guide is bullshit cause i upgraded from an i5 2500k to a i75820k it only cost $50 more than the i5 and i got almost twice the performance. so i guess im retarded based on this picture then hahaha.
That&#039;s funny because he said the exact opposite of that, you fucking white knight.

did it feel good senpai?
I upgraded from phenom II x4 955 to i5 6600k this year. Would recommend.
My last upgrade catapulted me from an AMD Athlon XP 3200+ to an Intel i5 2500K. I don&#039;t even know how many percent of computer power gain that translates into. That AMD was single core and still used AGP.
no more 24 hours for stuff to compile
I&#039;d be fine with a Core 2 Quad. Most people over-estimate how much they need out of their CPU, especially on /g/ where you have tons of retards buying an i7 for a gaming rig, but then getting a GTX1070 or something instead of a GTX1080.
For entertainment and/or internet dickery then at least 50% is my minimum. I recently upgraded an aging q6600 to 5820k so...

This basically, you already gave use to your current cpu and for &quot;the same price&quot; (money doesn&#039;t cost the same at two different times). Besides, nothing lasts forever either, if it&#039;s, for example, 10 years old I would consider changing it even if I don&#039;t reach the percentage I want.
This picture explains so well why every speccy thread on /g/ shows fucking garbage computers and why no one here uses their PC for anything but loonix ricing.
CPU-Z is reporting I&#039;ve got a 6 core on my Exynos 8890... Wtf. Anyone else having issues with CPU-Z?

Wow. All these idiots. So it is supposed to show 4xm1 and 4xarm. It isn&#039;t what&#039;s active and what&#039;s not. Do you really think that a program that reports what hardware you have relies on usage? &quot;Oh there was a core active but now it&#039;s not active, DOESN&#039;T EXIST LOL&quot;This guy gets it. Just updated the app and now it is showing fine.

why is ubuntu the best linux distro ever created?
because Margo Shuttlecock knows what is best for everyone
Unity looks outdated as fuck
Because their fucking titlebar is just unbeatable. I would still be using it if I didn&#039;t fuck my installation up so badly. Tried to compile it myself to fix some bugs, then I got some graphical glitches, uninstalled then everything went fucked. Now I&#039;m on Xfce. Maybe I&#039;ll try again in a month or two.

I&#039;m doing a lot of work with Latex (Texstudio) and the HUD feature is god-tier for math imput.
it&#039;s got some bugs and I can&#039;t even turn on the compositor because it actually CAUSES screen tearing. don&#039;t feel like reporting any bugs because the community seems toxic and they just say Xfce is perfect and it must be user error
what do you mean? you can type in equations in the search bar and it solves them?

It&#039;s maths you retard.
Ubuntu is clearly the best linux distro.  It has the most users and is easy to useIf you think it is, make your own distro.  Fly your flag and see how many people salute it.  We&#039;ll wait.
You mean the online search results in the HUD? Pretty sure that&#039;s disabled by default now

Don&#039;t like systemd?  tough shit, Ubuntu uses it and Ubuntu is Linux.  In 10 years every distro will use it.  Ubuntu is carrying the Linux torch, and that&#039;s just a fact.  They are leading the way.

Use Compton as a compositor. It&#039;s lighter weight, more flexible, and adds nice fading animations if you want.
Yep, it&#039;s really gross to use.  Makes me feel dirty.
I think you mean Mint...
Yes, at least for 16.04 (Xenial).
This otherwise i like unity top bar it&#039;s really good but other then that xfce is WAY better.
i actually use Mint, it&#039;s basically the same thing as Ubuntu LTS tb.h
Yep, not flat...
Linux has the capability of becoming mainstream and ubuntu is definitely  the best candidate at making it possible.
because Arch is unstable as fuck.
its NOT the best linux distro,
How the fuck does this actually happen in real life in a supposedly stable release version?
Whenever I use Unity I always install Numix GTK theme and Paper icons. It makes it somewhat bearable although not as bearable as comfy XFCE.
You misspelled Mint.

When did you realize this is the best language?
Always
At the letter G
But Go isn&#039;t D, how can it be the best language?
D is retarded
explain?
Botnet prog lang
Oh yeah totally
that&#039;s not the C logo silly
Go is improved C
Go is retarded
then why doesn&#039;t the garbage collector collect the language and throw it away?
Any language in CLR
Go embraced its Pajeet pandering and will slowly carve out a stable slice of that niche.
I don&#039;t even care.
I also like it alot. Am no real programmer, but doing my best to learn it in my free time. Go helped a lot. Great documentation, and no dependencies fuckery. If i need anything, i can simply write it by myself and import it or search for a lib on github and import it. The only thing which bugs me: I once wrote some simple things in Kotlin/Java in an IDE and i was blown away how great debugging was. Breakpoints. Steps. Since Go has also no real REPL (not like JVM based langs), i wasnt able to wrap my head around debugging in go till now. What&#039;s the best way to do so. Or do you simply relay on playground and testing?
It&#039;s like java with training wheels. If you&#039;re making some basic crud and most of the project is outsourced to brown people, look no further.
They&#039;ve stopped pushing the systems programming language narrative ages ago. Go is not competition for C, they both satisfy different roles.
Though, Go is specifically meant to be a C++ alternative, not C.
When I was in a parallel dimension. Then I came back and golang was Java without inheritance again.
a couple of months ago. rewrote around 60% of our services at work over into golang. Have never seen such stellar performance and stability.
you don&#039;t sound like you make a living in tech. Or, you are but are such a shitty developer that nobody wants you to write code. Or your company is actual trash.
I can go on all day.
Huge red flag.

when hello world compiled to 1.7mb
Piece of shit language. I dare you to explain why I much prefer Rust and Swift over Go.
To top it off, the designers clearly realized these shortfalls, and hacked around them by including a special-case generic map, built into the language. Would your map be faster if it was backed by a B-tree? Well fuck you then, you better get your Ctrl-C finger ready.
this desu
My PROS:You end up rewriting the same code over and over :S

You&#039;re a retard.
Go is the best language I&#039;ve used. Was easy to learn and got me a job pretty fast.

I think claiming they were a systems programming language was their single biggest mistake, especially when rust was a competitor. If they had been honest from the start and positioned themselves as a web backend programming language they could have had a lot more going for them I think.

How is it any different from rust trait objects?
trait is evaluated at compile time
GTFO
As far as I can tell from these Go threads--which always devolve into Go-bashing threads--it&#039;s probably a generation thing. Old-school UNIX hackers make a new language, millennial hipsters bash it because &quot;waaah it doesn&#039;t do what my meme functional flavour of the month toy language does&quot;.
Posting code written by a retard has nothing to do with how good or bad go is.
If I want to explicitly ignore the type system it should let me.
we just used it to pull some (a lot) of data from HitBox&#039;s API. It works, its fast to compile. Tho there is retarded stuff about the syntax and no generics. Also the project structure is weird.
They still have a lot going for them. It&#039;s also a great language for writing tools to inspect binary file formats without segfaulting all over the place, due to the (admittedly slow due to omg Reflection) binary.Read/Write
Don&#039;t worry about them, brother. I think Go is awesome and still come to these threads because I&#039;m a masochist I guess. Their loss for simply e
the world runs on the fucking web now, anon. Get over it
This, C++ 11 implemented this feature with the auto type. It&#039;s a modern feature that&#039;s very useful.
Made by Ken and Rob from Bell Labs, people that have put their names on a ton of minor projects such as UNIX, Plan9, UTF-8 and a little language called B which directly inspired Dennis Ritchie when he created C.
but alas as a corporate code monkey I must use C# in order to be as replaceable as possible
void * and other forms of weak typing can result in runtime crashes (ClassCastException in Java).
writing any non-trivial code can result in crashes
But whether that&#039;s a problem of the language itself, or of the contemporary programmer&#039;s propensity to use one language for everything, is another question altogether.
That&#039;s not an excuse. Strong typing helps you catch errors at compile time. Weak typed languages (Python, Ruby) are at their death bed.
Go isn&#039;t weakly typed - neither is Python btw
interface{} isn&#039;t a strong type and plays a big role in Go. I wouldn&#039;t call Go strong typed for the same reason that Java has with Object.
It was only a &quot;mistake&quot; in the sense that by doing so, they strangled Rust in the cradle. Go would be a sweeping success even without doing that, so it&#039;s not like it cost them anything.
You&#039;re the only who &quot;woudln&#039;t call Go strong typed&quot;.
Marshalling, printing and others depend on reflection. Or do you run a web server without writing JSON or XML?
How often do you get run time errors when using fmt.Print?
. Alternatives popped up like https://github.com/uber-go/zap. Having 3rd party libraries like that one to fix Go is a good indication of a bad language. Another interesting library is fasthttp.
It&#039;s quick handy logging. If you want it fast - use plain Write or the third-party libraries you mentioned yourself. Where is the problem with the language here?
 to be remotely safe?
That&#039;s a funny way of spelling clojure.
Go just lets you fuck yourself in the ass if you&#039;re into that sort of thing, but most people aren&#039;t likely to do something unsafe on accident.
And you can even completely avoid using it ever - just use io and strconv.

go sucks

Why is the logo so fucking stupid
Apple fag?

My fucking sides! I guess they don&#039;t call you gotards for nothing.
Though the common failure case, I find, isn&#039;t in segfaults but rather in something breaking and a stacktrace popping up. I don&#039;t know of a production go program that doesn&#039;t do that all over the place so it&#039;s not like it&#039;s caused by my inexperience, I think.
You can remove the stacktrace with build flags, but nobody does it because it&#039;s useful.
It&#039;s useful to never handle any of the billion errors that happen in production code? I doubt it.

What were you using before?
Might as well be upset about C for having functions. That&#039;s literally how stupid you sound.
fuck man I&#039;m really mad at computers right now
/mkg/ - Mechanical Laptop Keyboards Edition
Opinions on the Leopold FC750r? Might buy it with blue switches as my first keyboard
It&#039;s a solid board, coming with thick cherry profile PBT caps as stock is nice too.
Its got good build quality, thicc 1.5mm PBT keycaps in Stepsculpture 2 profile (its lower then OEM and more similar to DCS/Cherry [see pic]) as well as nkro and a detachable cable

soon
Does anyone know of a company that sells a &quot;Super-Man&quot; themed Super (&quot;Windows&quot;) key?I figured this would be more common, but I&#039;m not finding one.
I just ordered pic related. how did I do?
I&#039;ll never understand all that extra space at the top, it just looks odd to me.
80s design
its pretty I want to fuck it.
got a dot-com era Sun Microsystems keyboard and monitor in the mail soon
guest_open
In the olden days that where they put the controller. I think they kept it because its still the same keyboard case design from when the original g80 released in 1988
Is that double switches on enter and shift?
That&#039;s what it looks like. Fuck me that&#039;s retarded. I just noticed the non standard stagger too.
This is the chinkiest chinkshit I&#039;ve ever seen
looks to be so, at least on the shift
https://geekwhack.org/index.php?top

what did you expect anon? Its called geekwhack for a reason
That nonstandard stagger should be the new standard. It makes you move your fingers less. There is no point in using uneven staggering anymore since mechanical typewriters are long gone and forgotten.
christ fuck 3d printing can&#039;t become mainstream sooner
the actually use silicone molds, which you can set up yourself for like a couple thousand bucks
keyboard?


First anon was right, it was Tai-hao. Those are regular Matias switches, not quiet.
you guys recommend any styled keycaps for it?
anything from GMK to match the same profile if you are only planing to replace a few keycaps. Otherwise anything that matches the case like Dolch would be fine
What is that feel when?
What&#039;s your lighting setup here?
I bought the Elven alphas and nothing else from the last Granite run.  I&#039;ve got these red mods but I&#039;m bored with the look.  Should I get black blank mods?
what keyboard is that?
Airsoft?
literally any generic 60% keyboard
KBP V60
Never, ew.
how are the Matias standard clicky compared to mx blues?
Stiffer, heavier, deeper sounding, and a lot less scratchy. Better in every way imo. Keycap options are limited and even the AEK caps wiggle more than any cherry cap would.
Why couldn&#039;t you just only post your keyboard or nothing at all? not that hard.
Ew lever-actions with tube mags
ah thanks. i&#039;m doing a spring swap on the mx blues I salvaged with sprit 72g springs pretty soon for a heavier feel, but I might just buy a board with the Matias switches instead.
Also, are Matias switches compatible with cherry plates/pcbs?
http://builder.swillkb.com/ shows the plate cutouts for cherry only, alps only or both
All the ones I&#039;ve used were squishy, and the placement of the ESC key gets on my nerves.
Isn&#039;t that the standard position for TKL/fullsize boards?
Ok fine here.
Is the Tomoko the best poorfag/babby&#039;s first keyboard? Has good reviews and the TKL one is dirt cheap although I&#039;ll probably go for full size one.
The previous generations (what I used) had the escape key were backtick/tilde are on a standard keyboard, and an unlabeled dead key where ESC usually is.
Yes. Also, the Magicforce 68. Outemu switches are underrated right now.
thank you.
Than--waaaait a minute
Yo peeps, not a frequenter of this board, but I have a quick question.Do you ~keyboard experts~ think it&#039;s worth &quot;upgrading?&quot;
thank you. I will check out GMK. I&#039;m looking for a full set of &quot;interesting and/or classy&quot; keycaps
are these keycaps compatible with that cherry G80 3000?
Yes
I&#039;m surprised they kept the alt key, might as well went full mac and made it option.
Anyone who owns a topre gone back to cherry mx?
muh freedom
When will custom Topre PCBs and firmware exist?
Is this the new retro thread?
Paging tripfag
Autists.
I switch between topre, cherry mx and gateron multiple times a day
When will you get an alps board?
expecially the noise
I&#039;m an avid Type M user (IBM keyboard from the 80s and 90s) and won&#039;t use any keyboard that doesn&#039;t have good feedback and travel.  My girlfriend hated my keyboard until hers broke and I lent her my spare - I had to order another spare because she won&#039;t give it back.
Probably with my build after whatever I&#039;ll build next. I don&#039;t want to make another AEK themed byild, but they&#039;re the only nice alps keycaps around
Want it to click clack too.
Just the fullsize layout? Fullsize with dedicated media controls? Fullsize with additional programmable macro keys? Fullsize with both those things?
Also, what I really meant is the design.
Need a cheap rubber dome for work (can&#039;t waste time choosing the perfect mechanical, even if it was cheap). Which brands offer the best office standard keyboards?pic related, example of something I found new for 10€
oh, and it must be usb
Just got my Unicomp classic delivered last night. Definitely has a good feel to it for typing, no complaints so far. The cosmetic defect stuff has been way over exaggerated, it has one little blemish on the upper right corner that I couldn&#039;t even see without shining my flashlight  directly at it.
Oh, I do wish they had used the original model M&#039;s font for the keys. I didn&#039;t  really buy it for aesthetics though so it&#039;s not a big deal for me.
1 year in, already mushy
That&#039;s why I&#039;m asking for the ones with best quality, although I wouldn&#039;t complain if I had to spend 10€ a year, seems like a good bargain considering that I&#039;ll be trying out mechanicals for the time being.
hell 5€ a month in 2 years, and they last over 10 with the same perfect feeling.
I&#039;m getting a razer memeboard because stores here can&#039;t figure out to sell nice stuff that isn&#039;t GAMURXD. I don&#039;t know how to feel about this
the world is your &quot;store&quot;
One thing: open it up and move the wire so that it&#039;s not pinching, and wrap some electrical tape a few inches along the area where it comes out of the keyboard.  The cords for the USB versions suck (but you can order replacements for not too much, and they&#039;re easy to replace).
Also, if you seriously suggest hhkb, kys.
I&#039;m using the PS2 version.
why are ergo clears the god-tier switch for workplace environments? topkekpres don&#039;t even come close t b h
just order a realforce on amazon and if you do not like it, return it, get full refund
Wish I&#039;d sent it in for repair rather than just tossing it...  it was a great keyboard.
Either I&#039;m getting too old to be here or you are pure stage 5 linguistic cancer. Either way what the fuck did you just type?
There wasn&#039;t even anything with blue switches

he prefers ergo-clear to topre
That explains the underage memes in place of a legible sentence.

Compelling argument, but I&#039;ve gone through this on this general: I don&#039;t get free shipping, it would cost me about 30€ minimum for getting it and returning.
are you the guy complaining about vaporware and memes that was here yesterday? This is a retarded board with retarded memes, if you don&#039;t like it, you can leave, grandpa.
are you the same idiot who made the &quot;meme&quot;?
Thanks for confirming the underage.
Go ahead, put more words in my mouth.
gonna need the name of that top model
Seems to me like you&#039;re trying to take ownership of these dank memes. Apparently old people aren&#039;t allowed to have them.

ard-need-your-input-t14769.html

Staggering should just be gotten rid of entirely.
how many IBM is too many IBM?

Every time someone shits on staggering I see no proof or argument for their claims
what is it with hhkb users and good taste?Just wow
How do you get custom lettering on keycaps without it looking shit? Would want to try to get some black model M keycaps and add white lettering to them, like the Model M13.
Move your fingers up and down between rows m8, without trying to land on a specific keycap. There&#039;s no point in moving left or right along with up/down to hit certain keys. The staggering is a holdover from typewriters. Just like the qwerty layout.
This is a retarded board with retarded memes, if you don&#039;t like it, you can leave, grandpa.
If you sit your hands on the keyboard at a 45º angle (the most natural and comfortable angle) staggering makes complete sense. Your fingers fall right into the diagonals.
You&#039;ll doom us all.
That&#039;s why split ortho boards exist.
That would make the most sense.
pathetic.
Not every pleb is going to go straight from a staggered board to something like an ergodox. Standards are hard to change, go figure.
Have a kid and raise him with only ortho keyboards until he&#039;s 18. Then, give him a staggered one. Good luck.
full sized novatouch when reeeeeeeeeei just want a full sized topre keyboard that i can easily change caps to T H I C C pbt caps
thanks in advance

jokes on you the TKL novatouch has been discontinued already
so buy something else and buy the keyboard urself online
can you not buy novatouch stems separately?
god fuckin damnit
i imagine they wouldn&#039;t be expenisve though but idk
if you have a topre board, aliexpress is selling mx stems for like 0.05 each (packs of 10)
I have a Novatouch I&#039;m looking to sell actually. Got it for free, and have hardly used it before putting it back in the box.
good goys will eat it up
How is /mkg/ doing this cold Thursday morning? Underage meme kids do not reply.
the switches on the g410 is something you either love or hate I&#039;d suggest holding out for a deal on a cherry or cherry clone board

topre is shit t b h fampai :^)
Tomoko is cheaper right now on amazon
HMMMMMMMM insteresting

why do kids &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;trade&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; artisan keycaps?what&#039;s the point if another pleb gets to type on your 100$ jello puddi?

Why is backlighting bad? It lets me know what actuation setting I&#039;m on also.
As long as it&#039;s not RGB meme
just shitty looking
it just looks bad is all
I just keep it white.
This is a retarded board with retarded memes, if you don&#039;t like it, you can leave, grandpa.
go to reddit they seem to like them


 you asked senpai i was just sayian
I like them.
How are razers green switches?
And I think you have shit taste for liking them. But you&#039;re welcome to it, ofc.
Or you can buy one keycap and make the mold yourself
It&#039;s like you can&#039;t turn them off.
GOOD!
You mean, Kailh switches?
I mean they&#039;ve been rigorously tested by eSports athletes under the most demanding conditions, Razer Mechanical Switches are perfectly tuned to the specific needs of gamers. Featuring optimized actuation points and a durability that surpasses the competition, these impressive switches enable you to execute your commands faster than before, for even longer.
this better be bait
then why buy them in the first place. If you want cherry mounts you can but those for 5 cents a piece
Also the software that comes with the Realforce interested me.
Not sure if I got in on the 1965 Gb or not. Didn&#039;t realize I had to replace order until right now OOPS :^)
but I heard they have other specifications than all kailh switches? and they have other contractors?
Would you buy something made by kids in China, if for the same exact price you can get something made in Japan, America, Germany, and Korea?
hence, it&#039;s just a question. I&#039;m not asking &quot;should I buy a razer keyboard?&quot;
Well, some chink switches are better than Mx &quot;Sandy&quot; Cherry
Besides labor violations there is nothing wrong with chinese switches like outemu, kailh, greetech, etc. Some like Gateron are actually better then cherry switches. The thing with razer keyboards is that they charge a higher price just because of the snek logo on it
yes but how are the switches? I don&#039;t care about all this, I just wanna know how they feel, how they differentiate from other blues.
which considering how garbage razer&#039;s other shitty products are, means sweet fuck all
how can you say this when they have different actuation points and resistance?
The only Chinese switch I have is an outemu blue. Compared to the cherry equivalent mx blue its louder and even more higher pitched, as well as being heavier to press. One of the keys makes this annoying squeak when you press it down, but this is a result of the poor quality control, which Razer could have fixed in their switches, but I don&#039;t really know if they did. I&#039;ve also read online that people are reporting inconsistencies between the switches.
again, it doesn&#039;t even have close to same specifications as other chinese switches, so I don&#039;t see how that&#039;s relevant. the outemu blue is closer to cherry in the hard specs than it is to the razer switch.
If you want to buy a razer keyboard then go ahead. Its your money and I can&#039;t stop you. Now this style of switch has been around since 1985 and has come in wide range of varieties with different springs and metal leafs. I can tell you that the leaf can barely be felt and that the spring makes the biggest difference in the feel of the switch.
Long spacebars should be gotten rid of entirely.
Different sized keys should be extinct by now, to be hornet
I think a 2u space bar would be acceptable, with the rest of the keys being 1u
Two 2u keys, one for space and one for shift/backspace/enter/whatever.
I was actually being sarcastic, I love my huge ass ISO enter key and my long, shiny spacebar
you&#039;re just trolling me now, right?
Anyone got the Realforce RGB keyboard?Currently have the Type heaven.
The first mx style clicky switch was introduced in 1987, while the first mx switch was blacks in 1984. So I was wrong about the 1985 date.
You seem to be adamant on buying expensive, &quot;tuned for gaymin&quot; chinese keyboard, though. It&#039;s your money in the end.
I was gonna tell you it&#039;s shit but apparently you are used to it already
I&#039;ve multiple times stated that I have no interest in buying any razer keyboard (or anything backlight for that matter, it&#039;s an absolute dealbreaker for me), I&#039;m just curious about the feel of that specific switch, because it has different specs but are rather close to the blues, which are my faves

I just got this for $100. Did I do good?
Yes
It looks nice sometimes. My Mac Plus however, does not. Its lime green to my color blind eyes.

If you really wanted to make it look like a racecar add some spoilers
The racecar aesthetic was more of a side-effect, but you&#039;re certainly not the first person to tell me that I should add spoilers

I guess way  cheaper lubricants will do an equally good job.
Again, the price, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s so bad if I only buy one.
Some people claim lubing the hhkb ruins the sound
What most bothers me as a Type-S user is that some of the keys squeak. I don&#039;t know if lube would help with that, but if it reduces the overall noise I would like it.
Iirc tho the type-s comes with some lubing already on, or maybe it&#039;s only the silent realforce (with purple stems)
found this little memester for 10€. Owner says it&#039;s completely functional. Should I?
lol
what even is that spacebar LMAO
I mean, why even bother when the superior product for equally superior price is available?
Damn, lower than 10€? Where is it?
No, anon, &quot;superior&quot;, as in greater, as in it costs more. That&#039;s the joke.
I saw that keyboard new for over 200 dollars though, wouldn&#039;t guess it was so expensive. My only uncertainty is the adapter for that kind of connector (5 pin)
it looks like a standard ps/2 connector
that pic is from the internet. Here&#039;s the one for sale.
still looks like a ps/2 connector to me
bump
Just buy a &quot;live USB&quot; PS/2 adapter. I use one with that keyboard which I bought in 1999.
it&#039;s gone isn&#039;t it? typing with mouse atm.
I work at a school - found these bad boys in a storage room this week and they still work great
Currently typing on a WASD Code 2 100% with clear switches. I really, really like this board but I want to get something that&#039;s more clicky as this isn&#039;t the most enjoyable for typing long papers on, something that I&#039;ll be spending most of my time in college doing. As I described in the layout there are some things I need to have dedicated keys for but the rest can be Fn. Something that comes in (or can be nicely converted to) a miami or gray themed keycap set would be really nice.

So /g/, is there a program that can make you to enter a password or some shit like that before opening a folder? I don&#039;t want my family opening my porn/really important files when I&#039;m away and they&#039;re using my pc. Really appreciate any help.
shouldnt have any files you care about on the same physical drive as your OS anyway
Neat idea, but that&#039;s real hassle if you just want it to be there and I don&#039;t want to take the risk of losing it or breaking it.
the real question here is why are you letting people use your pc
Truecrypt (and all of its alternatives) let you do that
You can name the file container anything you want. The file cannot be opened unless you&#039;re using the program used to make the container. Name it something ambiguous. I.e. config, settings. Etc.
Encryption. Simply locking the file doesn&#039;t always work well, since there are ways around it. Using encryption will use math and shit to generate numbers which are used to scramble the data in a way which would only be unique to said numbers made by your password. Also name the folder something like &quot;official microsoft firmware&quot; or something, or name it like &quot;minecraft&quot; and change the icon, that way people won&#039;t fuck with it or delete it. Or just burry the folder deep in some thing in Program Files x86.
This is why you should be using Linux. Encrypt your home folder with a good password and never worry about it. Make a general account for your family to use that way they won&#039;t mess your shit up.
encryption makes it mathematically impossible to view your files, Truecrypt is a dead project these days though so use an alternative.
use a separate user. Will prevent simple attempts to access.

You guys arent understanding what OP needs, a program to password protect individual folders
The other question is 1) why are you downloading porn 2) get your own pc D) you have to be 18 to post here.
We know that. But we&#039;re all suggesting encryption because mere password-based access restriction at the folder and file level is piss easy to get around, however encrypting the folders and files isn&#039;t and still allows OP a convenient way of hiding his files

or he could just use an external drive like a normal human being, or simply make it a hidden folder, rather than faffing around with overkill methods like encryption
Op here, so I took one of your advice and sent my folder to one of the data folders of my games. I encrypted that, and sent a shortcut to my desktop. I replaced the icon with some important looking shit and renamed it, and make it fuck off to the corner where no one would expect it. And if they did they would have to get pass an encryption code to get in so there. Kind of an overkill if you think about it.
Oh, and I also marked it as a hidden folder.

it works well enough,still better than windows
For new users its pretty tough not to recommend it.
Duplicate that and you&#039;ll have a successful distro as well.
I have to agree with Cinnamon. It is really smooth and modern.  The multitasking/workspace switching is almost OSX calibre.
and animations are decent too. it really hits the sweetspot between design and usability. couple it with a nice theme and it can&#039;t be beat.
Agreed.  I&#039;d say its nice comfy middle ground between KDE for those that have to customise on an autistic level and has everything included to make tweaks and the other end of bare Gnome which you have to set every little thing up yourself and nothing in included.  Cinnamon is just cosy right out of the box and very intuitive.

it&#039;s the best distro for windows expats because it&#039;s Ubuntu LTS without a macfag debefore someone talks about security pic related
Xbuntu and Kbuntu and mate are all fine, but Mint is just a nicer experience for newbs who want productivity and a OS alternative to windows/osx
it&#039;s xubuntu and kubuntu you ding dong.  kubuntu is not fine either, buggy pos.  I agree on your other points though
best normie look by default, non retarded software configuration, but then again almost every debian based distro has non-retarded configuration by default
Because it works so well.
holy shit, memers just got BTFO
Mint is broken by design, with mixed packages from Ubuntu and Debian, with a broken apt implementation, with randomly renamed packages and programs just to be incompatible with every other Linux distro out there and make installing some packages impossible, without sufficient testing and with a &quot;community&quot; that hides the problems of the distro.
Stop memeing.
or literally just installing XFCE/LXDE/KDE in regular Ubuntu?
memeing this hard
stop memeing for once, Mint is fine for newbies and even not so newbies
I find Gnome kinda retarded desu - Mint is Ubuntu based though (Although there is LMDE which is Debian based).
Unfortunately most will be back on Windows because Mint managed to mix Ubuntu and Debian and create an OS more broken than Windows.
You&#039;re probably not wrong about things, but most people don&#039;t care and will trade usability for being a linux expert and all the sadness that goes with that.

Do you have a problem with Mint Debian Edition?
srsly, that screencap you are repeating is outdated as hell.

The meme is about Arch giving Linux a bad name but I think it&#039;s Mint that is giving Linux a bad name.
find me an Arch guy who is running same install for even 6 months
Yes they have had some security issues, and that is a concern certainly.  I&#039;m not sure where things stand there.
Mint fails at that at both the update policy and the spyware bundled with the default browser.
the package renaming was fixed, not that it ever affected anybody
This is wrong.
Inexperienced users wouldn&#039;t be updating any distribution properly, so really its not a big deal to chose one of 3 options, which you can go back and change later once you are better informed.

Jesus Christ, have you even used Mint 18 or are you just parroting what other people told you?
&quot;You are just using it wrong&quot;, &quot;I don&#039;t need that so you don&#039;t need that&quot;... nice argument there...
Mint users are living in a bubble and can&#039;t comprehend that some want OS that are stable and dependable
maybe you should just get a mac if literally the easiest linux distro is too hard for you
Have you used Mind Debian Edition?  Are you aware of it even?
Its literally the friendliest easiest to use OS next to OSX
What I find disgusting is that Mint is giving Linux a bad name with the bad community and the general instability
www.apple.com
What you find so disgusting seems to come 3rd hand from forums rather than personal experience.
I&#039;m sure the Mint devs are capable of breaking Debian just as they have broken Ubuntu.
I think I hear your mum calling you.
Cinnamon is pretty nice. I think next time I go Linux I&#039;ll install it into arch or something
it&#039;s duckduckgo, obv if you don&#039;t know how to change your default search engine you should probably not be using Linux
if you&#039;re new, install ubuntu faggots
All the mildly competent simple users would find this behaviour suspicious if it happened on Windows.
The fedora tip is strong within this one. My Mint installation is working fine.
Donald Knuth is not new and uses Ubuntu
Hes right though
I thought Mint was supposedly newbie friendly
Its not routing anything through mint servers, that is pure BS.
It&#039;s extremely difficult to break it.
Yeah, it breaks by itself shortly after installation, no user interaction required
if you didn&#039;t download that iso that day you were fine.  admittedly it&#039;s not a good look
Again, a lot of people, including me, are very happy with Linux Mint. So wtf, is your problem? That people are happy?
Everyone, litterally, everyone can be hacked. Its just a matter of resources.
I&#039;d still be using Mint if it didn&#039;t limit itself to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Very nice distro but I want to be more up-to-date.

Shuttleworth was finally forced to acknowledge that Clem was right, when Shuttleworth responded to user demand and created an Ubuntu MATE edition.
Unreasonable shilling
no spyware that I&#039;m aware of.  like i showed you in that post above, websites think I use Ubuntu
Still a Mint branded search engine is in bad taste and really suspicious.
The Mint team was just responding to the unfortunate reality that Ubuntu&#039;s non-LTS releases had gotten pretty bad.  They didn&#039;t really want to limit Mint to LTS versions, but they saw it as the only way to fix the problem.  I&#039;m hoping that eventually Ubuntu can start doing better non-LTS releases, allowing Mint to revisit that decision.  But the blame is entirely on Ubuntu for this.
this.  literally fucking this.  everyone shitting on Mint is using something harder to use, like Debian or Arch or whatever... but they are bitching for things like &quot;hey in Mint you have to select which updates you want to install and press install!&quot;  or &quot;hey!  in mint the default homepage on firefox is a linux mint page!&quot;
Not him but what are you talking about? The default search engine in Firefox on Mint is Yahoo, which I think is also the default search engine in Firefox on Windows.
what a bunch of dicks
linux mint may looks nice, but under the hood, it&#039;s horror
They didn&#039;t even bother to change a string!
I used Mint about two weeks ago and I&#039;m 95% sure you&#039;re wrong on this.
please
Because we are not braindamaged by the Mint way

mint chocolate is good xd so why not loonix ? :^)
I&#039;m a normie, so I might appear &quot;strange&quot; to someone like you who has an autism-spectrum disorder.
The reason that Mint runs faster is because Clem is a better programmer than all the people who work on Ubuntu combined.
Life must be difficult for you.
This is an embrace-extend-extinguish tactic.
The same users that have to choose between stability or breakage?
That only means the number of times each respective distro entry has been accessed on their site
This whole thread illustrates how toxic the Ubuntu community is, the fact that they spend so much time trying to squash anything that doesnt fall in line with the exact way Ubuntu does things. Im pretty glad we have someone like Clem who can give sensible choices to users instead of Shuttlecock trying to be a freetard Steve Jobs with his bullshit Unity
Mint is a ticking time bomb
here you go https://github.com/linuxmint/xed
You have to choose between stability and breakage on a lot of distros. Not saying this isn&#039;t a problem with Mint, but how come I never see this attack directed at other distros?
can you quit pretending that updates have never fucked anybodys shit up except in Linux Mint?
:^)
I just switched from linux mint after using it for about a year. It&#039;s bulletproof.
delete this
No other stable OS, especially one targeted and shilled (because that&#039;s what you are doing right now) to inexperience users has a BIG-FUCKING-RADIO-BUTTON that says BREAK-MY-SYSTEM or LET-MY-OS-INSECURE
Expect the Mint shilling brigade to soon tell how you-don&#039;t-really-need-that or clem-knows-best
installed update since 17.1, 2.5 years same install currently on 18 with the latest kernel
There are several, well documented, issues with Mint. One only needs to do a simple Google search to find what these issues are.Unfortunately for the userbase, the lead dev is stubborn. Despite legitimate criticism the larger linux community, Clem is going to continue to expose his users to security issues in the name of &quot;stability&quot;.
i follow the ubuntu and mint forums and everytime kernel updates it fucks someones wifi/graphics/bluetooth up etc
Lol yeah we are just leaving them there because we don&#039;t care because we are that hardcore!!
Did Clem send you??
don&#039;t be such a pussy
Because its windows without being windows
Mint attracts the worst kind of Windows users
I think you need to review your definition of &quot;Broken&quot;

it&#039;s retarded, man

who&#039;s fault is that? whitey&#039;s?
These old-school elitist whites need to die off once and for all.
so literally NOTHING of value?
it&#039;s not white people&#039;s fault you fucked up in school by being so weak you caved to peer pressure instead of being strong and studying.
ok
For the people in that room driving it, there&#039;s tons of money. But no there&#039;s no value in the recipients being spoonfed.

Your reasoning is pathetic and typical of scared white dinosaurs facing extinction.
they&#039;re good, not great. it&#039;s always the white people with the best ideas. asians are number crunching machines tho
take your ((Steven Spielberg)) crap somewhere where people will give you credence.
true. thats why I was asking for a source. I dont see asians leading anything.

There are more nonwhites in engineering positions in all major US tech firms than whites these days. It&#039;s the uneducated whites that are mopping up the floors, not the other way around.
Microsoft, Google, Adobe, MasterCard, PepsiCo, Global Foundries etc. etc.
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
really made me think (that you don&#039;t have a white collar job)

All major US companies should only have 40% white leadership to reflect the diversity of America, and yet over 99.5% are white. That&#039;s fucked up and you know it.
And yet you have massive failures like Enron, Yahoo, Bear Sterns, etc.
what you are proposing is fucked up for everyone who worked hard for something in their lives, and you know it.  This is why Trump is president now.
And yet black men are massive failures at integrating into American society.
Those are individual failures, it&#039;s only a race failure when it&#039;s brown people. Or women.
How is asking for accurate representation of a changing workforce &quot;fucked up&quot;? Nonwhite outnumber white Americans. More nonwhites are entering fields which were once dominated by whites through discrimination and institutional racism
kys

Maybe they suspect Trump might be running a mini-bar scam.
This kills the POO IN LOO
I fail to see how or why this is a problem. The last thing we need is niggers or other shitskins pretending like they understand technology.
Whites invented math you retard.
What country are you rambling about. Most US Doctors are pajeets.
I&#039;m sure everyone on that board is an ace mathematician.
For example, the tech nigger doesn&#039;t contribute anything to technology, he just spells out tech specs for illiterate tards.

Can we all agree that Foobar2000 is the best media player currently?
b-but muh loonix

No
It&#039;s not even close to Foobar. It doesn&#039;t have library support for starters. Just because it looks barebones upon the first startup, doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s like Foobar. How about you actually inform yourself about it or maybe use the software before throwing such comparisons around?
Though I have no problem with Windows lurkers, can you stop making threads for a fucking Windows music player?
No
Doesn&#039;t do usf/miniusf and a few others + it looks like shit.
Yes, by far.
Overrated trash.
What&#039;s a good music player for linux that isn&#039;t ugly and bloated as fuck, while also having good customizability.
MPD.
Gmusicbrowser, audacious, or an mpd frontend.
What&#039;s wrong with Winamp?
A media player should be able to play videos.
I&#039;m a loonix user, I don&#039;t have this player, I use Audacious.
Do you seriously think /g/ can agree on anything ?
Best in what?

If you can link me to good doc about pulseaudio I&#039;d be glad of that. Otherwise, pic related.
No. Google Play Music.
cmus, my frraindss
Back to your safe space tranny
Yes, if it was on Linux this wouldn&#039;t even be debated.
Does anyone winamp?
I can&#039;t make foobar easily work with my ipod and the default &quot;theme&quot; looks like ass. It&#039;s lightweight which is nice,  but I still don&#039;t know how to use it.
Yes
You probably yell &quot;feminazi!&quot; whenever a SJW tells you to shut up while doing this here for no reason, right?
Make your own layout, play around with preferences. And for iPod, there&#039;s an easy to use iPod syncing plugin you can download. Just google it.
go away anita

nice try bill but it won&#039;t be that easy to bait us cool linux users
Yes, but stop making these stupid threads.

Go fuck yourself.
best music player, you moron
of course we can, it&#039;s also comfy as fuck

It&#039;s literally not even a botnet.
my childs name is backwards on this screenshot
So to answer to your question I have no clue because I have never needed to try others before.
Go back to foobar.
I do still use it but it has an odd problem with an internet radio I sometimes like to listen. It randomly cuts out. Doesn&#039;t happen if I open the stream with VLC or any other player. Never used to happen with foobar either before I reinstalled windows.
mpd+ncmpcpp (Linux), MusicBee (Windows) master race. I&#039;d use ncmpcpp for everything, but unfortunately it glitches the fuck out on some of the stuff I have that has cyrillic in the filenames and I don&#039;t feel like renaming my entire collection just to please a &#039;tarded windows binary. When I switch to Linux fulltime, though, I don&#039;t think that&#039;ll be an issue. It has to do with Windows retarded file naming format.

nice work, lad.
now i need to replay one more time that album, thanks
what plugin for the integration in win10? plez i need it
no thanks
Why is UI customization such a mess in foobar? I miss the days when I could download a winamp skin from internet and it_just_werks.jpg. With foobar I have to have a specific version, download billion outdated and unrelated plugins and fiddle around in config files to get it work.
If you hate tweaking, foobar is not for you. Don&#039;t use it, it&#039;s that simple.

I would if there were any. Foobar is the least worst music player on windows right now. I&#039;ll probably switch back to winamp once the new devs stop dicking around and actually release something.
how an I get the library to update automatically?I have been using foobar for a couple years but I never really needed it
Nonfree pig disgusting crap.
like this



“Free software” means software that respects users&#039; freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer”. We sometimes call it “libre software,” borrowing the French or Spanish word for “free” as in freedom, to show we do not mean the software is gratis.

because the people who up their shitty custom skins for foobar always have a bunch of useless components that no one ever uses
Windows users should be able to discuss software, too.
oh cmon really, I&#039;m a lazy fucker, give me the .dll pls
it seems I had already done that, but it says &quot;error!&quot; next to the folder name

DEAD COW
thank

literally what in the shit are you talking about
Normies can make due without Foobar.I got a huge library of obscure video game format music that can only be played with Foobar
amen, brother. not that you can&#039;t play midi in fucking winamp or whatever.
anybody uses hardware EQ? if so anybody can recommend any? I already have an audio interface
idk
idk
I asked for this
No, it&#039;s buggy, looks like shit, and the organizing sucks. Just like every other media player.
Anyone experience things like this before?
I like it. And that is why I use it.
Im pretty sure the foobar creator didnt make it free software because he didnt want millions of copies of it


OP made a thread whose the whole point was a Windows music player. This simply belongs to technophile and/or Windows forums.
tl;dr: it&#039;s basically a desktop thread.

actually its called repetition and its a key persuasion technique. Rage Against The Machine&#039;s best song is Bullet In the Head

No, it doesnt have any polished ui and &quot;skins&quot; for it ale laughable.
i know thats a different song but i think they do this is on all of them
That&#039;s funny way of spelling &quot;Musicbee&quot;
No but it&#039;s the best music player.
A bullet in ya head, you gotta bullet in your fuckin&#039; head
That reminds me Cyrano de Bergerac, the last act makes me cry every time.


Media also implies images and video. Does foobar include a video player now?

you can write components
This makes it so when I press the Windows key and the right bracket I go next in my playlist, could I do this with Foobar2k without having to learn an entire scripting language?
This is just normalfag shit
C++ is not a scripting language
e
It&#039;s literally the ONLY good media player. Especially on linux.
that looks like osx
try again
Kek
Self

while components and skinning scene for foobar is mostly died away, it at least still updates. i used winamp religiously ever since i downloaded my first mp3 with napster. i eventually had to make the switch to foobar because winamp really doesn&#039;t handle libraries well, and tagging, art display and the customization experience with foobar is just so much better than winamp.
You mean one self explanatory line instead of 10 lines of C++?
It&#039;s funny that you lincucks are always overcomplicating things, because your ridiculous lack of software support always forces you to basically reinvent the wheel in your terminal, which is just short for terminal cancer

How about Banner Saga 2? If it works, I will install this.
it means dick in some slavic languages, maybe in Czech too
It can play DX9 games just fine. I really hope someone could make a DX11 patch for XP.
It means &quot;end&quot;, never heard of it being used for dick, maybe in russian?

Hey so if I use any of these does that give OP control over my OS? I mean maybe he&#039;s issued them from a master POS account or something? Not that I know how any of this works but it&#039;s something you&#039;d expect for a pos system.
good goy, this will be $19.999 + tax

include me in the screencap
Please do go on about how you run a 64-bit OS on 32-bit hardware.
Windows Embedded Standard 2009 user here. I protect the image with FBWF.
Windows 10 LTSB is too, it have 2 licensing options: Volume(MAK,GVLK) and as IoT enterprise(digital entitlement). IHVs uses digital entitlement for the embedded devices using LTSB.
Kek has shown us his will. Windows CE is the future
Dx11 for win xp fucking when
It would be extremely painful,
Downloading this to put on my Fujitsu Lifebook P1120.
That is only available for specified developmental boards. Even the MSDN .iso are that way. The IoT pro are also only available to the same set of development boards, and is simply a license file to be added during build/installation of the image. As for IoT enterprise, it is identical to LTSB with a different EULA and is activated with a Digital Entitlement.
A dx12 patch for 7 and 8.1 would be better.
Actually installed this. Installing 172 updates now. Runs like a dream on my 1st generation atom. Even  lighter than Linux.
With a permanent key. There is no activation, you just install it with a real key or a trial key.
Just make sure you typed the first or third key found in OP&#039;s comment. Not the second one. It is basically a volume key and require no activation.
Checked.
nice.
top kek
He has spoken, POSready is the /g/ approved OS from now on.
Really I already see quite a few that don&#039;t support DX9 anymore, but how many don&#039;t support anything older than DX12?
Is it really more lightweight and fast than Linux?
I used to love XP, but come the fuck on now. At this point it&#039;s almost as limiting as using the average linux distro, except loonix has up to date software.
kek
But can you activate the other embedded versions the same way?
wat

checked
Windows 10 LTSB GVLK or MAK or DE
As someone who otherwise uses no nonfree software, POS is pretty good to use the few pieces of proprietary software that I need to run.Runs well on old hardware and in VMs, which is convenient.
good thread

Can you mod it to get Office 2007 or 10 working?I occasionally need to convert docx to pdf files without any change in formatting. My current solution is a W7 VM, but it runs like shit.

So why aren&#039;t we memeing embedded 7? No leaked keys?
WES7 have several leaked keys. It allows selection of components during install as well. Pretty neat.
To add on, WES7 ends support in 2021 instead of 2020

where can i download wes7?

What do you think of Windows Embedded 8?
I&#039;d rather use Windows 10 IoT
Can you actually use it as a desktop?
Pirates, anon? Surely it&#039;s been tampered with.
Windows 8 Embedded Standard have no known activation methods as of yet, unless you buy a device that comes with it.
Does Microsoft Office work normally on Windows 7 Embedded? I want to use it in a VM.
Oops, for the second picture it was supposed to be the list with the 2 checkboxes: Modify Drivers and Modify Features. Select modify features and follow the guide to debloat the install, or simply click next and skip customization completely.
Yes. However Application Compatibility template is recommended or else some dependencies for Office might be left out.
I am... don&#039;t know about the others...
Of course.
will it run everything? including directx11 accelerated applications?

There was no scandal, just a bunch of tinfoil hat wearing tech illiterate retards talking nonsense. Kind of like the shit you hear about SELinux every now and again.
whats the use of windows embedded? does we7 look like op?
They look like the OS they&#039;re based on. WES looks like Windows 7 and WE8 looks like Windows 8
Anyone here used Windows 7 Thin PC?Sounds tempting desu
Tried it before, prefer WES7/POSReady 7.
I&#039;m set up now but xp can&#039;t see my wireless adapter with the default utility. What&#039;s a good WiFi utility that&#039;ll allow me to connect based on the bssid and not the ssid?  I have shit tons of networks around me with same name and windows often confuses itself and connects to the one furthest away.
Not exactly a utility method though
check&#039;d
tfw only 3 people have made reference to this being an elaborate, low-key AIDS joke
Can I expect full directX 11 compatibility with W7 Embedded?
THIS, what about my pirated video games?
POSReady 2009 confirmed for /g/ official OS

It works on bare metal?
just run Win10 LTSB mate
Piece of shit
You&#039;re a what?
Neat, I&#039;m actually excited to test this.
Fuck no
If you want security you don&#039;t fucking run Windows or even WANT to run Windows, which cannot be made secure.
Because it&#039;s stupid and off topic.

You should always use a USB condom. Don&#039;t dip your wick unless you covered the tip, bro!
Does it run all software that Windows XP would run?
Adobe CS6 runs fine on it too.
Yes, as long as you base your image on Application Compatibility
Hello, virgins. Wondering what language your average faggot prefers to use fo&#039; makin&#039; shit fo&#039; da sailfone. I heard a pair of NEETs talking and one argued for Java while the other felt HTML5 is the future. (I didn&#039;t hear gookfruit mentioned at all, but I know fuck all and thought C or maybe C++ was used for Apple.)What say you? I&#039;m bored with getting laid all the time and would like a new hobby.
definitely html
Thanks I just got firedSomeone report him, I have to pack my stuff
Fair enough. But why? Is it because you guys (programmers) are burnt out on C and C++? It seems many vets have a C variant in their pro/personal background.
thanks for the pape OP but blue board

you deserve to be fired
Honestly I&#039;m not sure exactly what the process of designing a user interface looks like with a programming language but QT (which is the big dog&#039;s biscuit as far as that goes) just uses XML
Lurk for two more years before posting again.

No, you literally did not get the reference to an ancient meme because you&#039;re this new. Either lurk more or fuck off.
Remember when Apple wasn&#039;t total shit?
No.
When was that?
Fucking dongles.... ugh.
You realize that the biggest dongle you carry is the power brick. Do you carry that always?
No, that would be my dick.
what the fuck do you need macOS for?

Some of us have jobs and need to run industry standard software and MacOS is miles better than Windows
(You)
Of course removing ports cost more, it is a bigger risk and also thinner and nicer.
Also (you)
I really don&#039;t.
How the fuck did you go from &quot;industry standard software&quot; to servers?
I just know that you&#039;re some wannabe designer fag that actually thinks this is correct because he kept hearing other retards repeating it.

IT then finds the keyboard wasn&#039;t plugged in
See above
when wozniak cared about the company
I guess you also forgot that literally all of that works on Windows and you can build tailor made machines specifically for those tasks that doesn&#039;t cost 3k dollars.
Wannabe designer fag confirmed
Nope, mainly music, photography and video
Jobs-era Apple was god tier.
Tell us how it is better anon. Not just the things your co-workers and applel friends told you like &quot;Mac is better for editing&quot; :^)
Underrated.
DAWs work better on MacOS because it actually uses Coreaudio drivers so you don&#039;t have to fuck around with that. Adobe programs aren&#039;t better but MacOS as an OS is, especially for laptops since Windows doesn&#039;t even have basic features like virtual desktops
I&#039;m genuinely curious, what software is this&#039;?
What is there other than GIMP, which is honestly worse than MS Paint.
if you seriously need dongles, then perhaps youre not progressing fast enough with tech anonever thought about that?
REEEEEEEEE
First post best post.
No it wasn&#039;t.
Apple II was alright I guess.
Are people really blaming Apple for USB-C now?
So about 30 years ago
(You)


I bet this numale has an apple watch too.
USB-C is the future so the sooner the older ports are dealt with the better.
Who whined about getting rid of serial ports? I don&#039;t remember.
It&#039;s the crybabby cycle of life.
I don&#039;t remember anyone bitching about serial going away.
paint.net, really, try it out

lol ik im gonna get the bully, but i&#039;m 17, Apple has always been shit for me
FPBP
Only $30 each!
Why not just have a usb hub and only use one cable. When do you actually need all those ports at once when you are on the move.
Yeah and it&#039;s making me sick.
Just kill yourself pajeet.
How do we stop this?
You literally can&#039;t. It&#039;s too late.
Yeah. This really screws with us neckbeards 24/7&#039;ing the keyboard.

Yeah, I&#039;ve noticed the occasional requirement to do two or three of them, when my answers have been clearly right.

Just use legacy captcha. God why is /g/ so fucking technologically illiterate?
I never need to worry about that with my pass
no but you need to worry about that cock up your ass
Legacy captcha is shit too
mook should offer a non-google captcha alternative desu
Is it a good brand?
No
if you like 2/3 hour battery life, sure
NoThey&#039;re only known here for thinkpads, and the good models were mostly from IBM times or based on those
thinkpad or don&#039;t bother
Memes aside, for laptops they can be good value for the specs. I don&#039;t have a problem recommending their budget options to friends who I know are going to leave it plugged in most of the time.
I wouldn&#039;t even bother with a ThinkPad at this point.
My yoga is a good shitposting machine and pretty solid. Wouldn&#039;t have it as my main computer though.
Literally spies on you, but /g/ loves to defend them while shitting on every other company, because dude memes lmao
It&#039;s great if you like preinstalled unremovable malware
They make the only Google Tango enabled smart phone.
This is true until you want to upgrade hardware because you can&#039;t. The BIOS checks hardware IDs against a hardcoded whitelist and won&#039;t allow you to boot anything if something fails, and the whole thing is encrypted.
It&#039;s the 1366x768 company
When Lenovo took over thinkpads, they took an immediate and noticable drop in qualitySeeing my first Lenovo thinkpad disappointed me, after that point they were just normal cheapass notebook laptops with nubs
they&#039;ve been fucking up the thinkpad line for 5 years.  but they aren&#039;t financially bulletproof and can be forced to reverse a bad design decision if enough dorks throw a tantrum about it.  the 40 series trackpoint non-buttons were scrapped in a single line refresh because they&#039;d lose sales.  they&#039;re still considering a retro line to placate the most vocal nerds.  apple isn&#039;t going to even pretend to listen to your complaints and the dells and acers of the world are just gonna ape whatever apple&#039;s doing.
Modern ThinkPads are still shit, though.

How&#039;s Ubuntu on your yoga? I had issues a while back when I installed 14.04 on my Yoga 3 14. Any driver issues?
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
While we&#039;re talking about Chinknovo, does anybody have any experience with the Yoga Book? I thought it was a pretty neat design.
No, they&#039;re a disgrace for what they did to ThinkPads.

If I have no related work experience, what should I call my work history section on the resume?It&#039;s currently Professional Experience, but I don&#039;t think that fits since.
i wouldnt expect a front end dev to know anything about performance anyway, but yeah CSS is fine for simple changes like hover effects to change color, etc etc. Anything heavy with detail or animation, def wanna use JS...
Simply have a section called &quot;Experience&quot;.  Let the HR tards work out whether something is work experience or academic.
I&#039;m trying to not look like a potato.
is php7 /g/ approved?
What does JS do? You mean jQuery animations like slide(), hide(), show() or whatever? Aren&#039;t they just calling CSS properties anyway, e.g. for hide(), it actually just adds &quot;display: none&quot; to an element etc.?
No.
Yes.
I can&#039;t think of shit to make to git gud. Nodejs here
Reminder that /dpt/ is more active and you&#039;re more likely to get an answer to your webdev related programming questions there.
The animations themselves are not using the CSS animations.
Not really. You post any web-related question, you get responses like &quot;learn a real programming language&quot; or &quot;&gt;webdev&quot;.
spotted the LISP basement wizard faggot.
If you use it for anything else then use it to program a time machine to go back a decade where you belong.
What&#039;s wrong with hamburger menus and what should I use instead?
This basically.
They are good, but it&#039;s not very smart to use them on a desktop site where you probably have enough space to fit a whole navigation. People use navigation links less when they are hidden, so keep that in mind.
So normal navigation bar on pc/laptop and hamburger menu when resizing on mobile?
Yes. If there are not many links you could try to even display all of them on mobile too, but hamburger is fine. It&#039;s what almost everyone uses anyway.
Can I extend a Javascript object to handle conditional or regex matched keys?If not, I guess I&#039;ll just preprocess the values.
Correction: Obviously the syntax would not be to have the conditional in the full quotes.
Just add a getter method that handles your conditionals
Also while your animations are running open chrome dev tools and enable paint flashing, so yo can see when the page repaints. If your animations are being handled by the GPU you shouldn&#039;t see that happen.
I want to have a light and dark color scheme on my website, but when the user switches a theme it should display on every page and not reset itself.Does anybody know how to save the selected stylesheet during a whole session, in Wordpress?
Fucking pajeets.
Fuck off.
stopped reading there
Just use the word &quot;menu&quot; on the button instead and your menu is automatically far more usable.
You are late, mate. That&#039;s not the case anymore. 3 lines are the standard and everyone uses them. But that was true X years ago.
Well it is literally at the end of the last sentence
Hey, WP can be deeper than just installing a premade template and customizing colors, you know? You probably haven&#039;t even tried it properly. I spent a lot of time on this project, even though it uses WP. Custom functionalities, all the frontend stuff and design. It has its uses.
mburger-menus/
Daily reminder: The panama papers were leaked because of an outdated Wordpress slider plugin.
I read that article, I know. I already said to the guy in the previous post that they are still not great for usability, but if there are many links, there&#039;s not any other good solution for it. But I was telling you that people can recognize 3 lines at this point, that&#039;s really not the main problem.
To be clear, I&#039;m not really defending WP either, I don&#039;t like it that much, but as I said, it can be pretty decent for specific cases.
Honest question here, should I learn PHP /g/?Thanks
and since php is either first or second only to java in web dev use, you best be learning php7
I could also just make my object giant and leave out the getter, because the possible cases the conditional has to catch are finite, only like 100. But it seems gross to do that.
It is so ubiquitous that I would say every web dev should know php in addition to whatever language they may prefer over it.  There is always php dev work out there.
What are they using then? CSS is the only way to change positioning of an element afaik
(Most stuff I find is how to write your own mySQL login thing but I remember that stuff pretty well)
They can recognize the word &quot;menu&quot; even better than 3 lines. Just do that instead.
Is freelance webdev/coding work possible?  i want to work from home.
Yes. Why do you want to work from home though? Freelancing requires a lot of networking so it isn&#039;t good for autists that want to avoid interaction with other people.
Why is it so hard to make pretty design?
Mouse thread?a
you suck at games and you think it&#039;s your mouse&#039;s fault
No, I just want to get my favorite mouse.
I bought SteelSeries Rival 100how much did i fucked up?
It&#039;s a mouse, wgas
Putting zowie in stupid just proved you&#039;re a fuckhead with no clue OP, well done.
remove logitech from anything above aspergers tier because they cant make mice for shit
Its what Kinzu should be since always.
Replaced my mx518 with a g502 RGB over black Friday. Nothing wrong with the mx518 so using it at work now. Holy balls the 502 is heavy though. Besides it weighing 8 pounds it&#039;s bretty gud
I didn&#039;t make this list dumb ass...  It&#039;s the first image on google for mouse /g/ list and it&#039;s like 5 years old.
Why does the logitech g pro gets no love here?
Ok so i&#039;m pretty damn satisfied with my Razer Deathadder, the sensor is perfect and the shape is amazingly comfy, but i want a wireless solution for gaming.Anyone got an experience with lgotech G403?
I have a Steelseries Sensei but I want to get something with a newer sensor that has a similar shape to the Sensei, is Zowie the way to go? Needs to have a DPI switch
Is the 3310 still the best sensor?
There is no better mouse than the g9x./thread
Maybe a modern deathadder. The original version is GOAT and virtually indestructible.
Tired with my cheap 20 dollar chink shit mouse, ordered the g502. What am I in for?
Disappointment.
Great mouse tbqfh
no regrets
nothing will ever beat the mouseman dual optical. ever.
not sure if its sold anymore
i have that rat 7, it works fine after almost 10 years, and it&#039;s the only decent mouse with a good pinkie/thumb rest, money well spent. it&#039;s hard to clean though
unless, of course, your intent was to troll in the first place. because then it certainly fills its purpose.

/g/ What is your opinions on Hackintoshes? Just build my first Hackintosh. Pic related although it&#039;s not my build. Whats your opinion on it /g/?
is this the new hackintosh desktop thread?
Develop for someone. Have them pay for your Macbook.Not only are Hackintoshes a bit of a pain (and much more so when you have to update anything) but it&#039;s also silly for you to make work for yourself just for the honor of doing work.
what kind of tool would build a hackintosh and then use the shit apple keyboard and meme mouse? also are those ridiculous apple monitors?
Hackintoshed T420 user here. Besides Wifi and SD card slot, it works just fine, even the dock. Best $175 &quot;mac&quot; that there will ever be
you can buy a compatible wifi card for like $15
Apples desktops are outdated, underpowered and overpriced shit. I can see why someone would want to have a hackintosh.
Yeah, i have a USB dongle now because i didnt want to flash the modded BIOS.
To my ears that actually sounds like a wonderful development machine. Devs using high end rigs in a complete disconnect from the typical end-user is why we have Electron garbage floating around everywhere, for example.
It would be excusable if it was the previous gen keyboard. Those are really nice for a rubberdome.
Recently built one myself. Very easy compared to the past. Everything is more or less streamlined
fair point
I don&#039;t already own a mac to do whatever any tutorial ever asks me to do. I have a lat d630 that ive been wanting to hackintosh
Obviously OP can&#039;t afford one or doesn&#039;t want to waste money on one.
For thse that can afford a mac by all means buy one, but for those cobbling shit together, just go with Mint.
your dumb
how does that monitor setup work out for you? it&#039;s the same thing i&#039;ve been thinking of doing.
That is literally it.
What version of OSX are you running on it?
Yeah, if you want something that runs macOS, go the hackintosh route. It will save you so much money in the long run.
Not only will you save money but you can dual boot Linux, and Windows for you gaming and tux needs.
Hackintoshing isn&#039;t hard at all these days. It&#039;s honestly really not that much more difficult than just installing your Linux distro of choice, but with the benefit of commercially supported software.

you might actually want to put your hand into a blender
/
I installed el capitan on my x220 but then I never used it after that. I don&#039;t know why I did it. It just takes up space on my HDD. It was a waste of time
is there any way of doing this with just a usb? like linux? everything I see requires a dvd drive
Just use a burner Apple ID.
so run that in vm ware and then what? do you have a guide to follow?
Every machine is different. If you have a pepular device such as a thinkpad or NUC, someone will have made a guide and supplied the proper kexts. Google your model and follow that guide. If its a built computer, google the names of all of your components or something. Idk.
OP Why not just run it in a VM?
Maybe because it is insanely resource heavy. 3Gb of RAM on IDLE
lol
He who dies with the most unused RAM wins.
I&#039;ve been using hackintosh for a few months. I like it enough to use as my main OS, but I have to admit I do miss some games and some customization. Still, what works really does work well.And pages, fucking pages giving me no trouble with stupid simple shit like Word does to this day.
it runs like crap in a VM
Just get cDock, GeekTool and Bartender 2.
Not him, it&#039;s not just a matter of RAM. It also needs some slightly decent GPU
I never managed to get it to run properly with intel graphics (intel 4600 HD) on desktop. I do have my 280x but still was curious about just using an igpu.
I wonder if some day apple will release a dark theme that covers more things than just the global menu and the dock.
Think about a more profitable line of work, you clearlyhave failed at this one.
tl;dr: JUST DO IT!
No, i just choose not to waste money on something that is over priced.
More like fagintosh thread, lmao.
You may want to get that checked out, anon.
Boom! You have an OSX installer.
that&#039;s dumb, just use the built in tool to make a bootable usb from the VM
Do you mean doing USB passthrough to the VM?
ateinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/USB --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ (your os x version).app --nointeraction

Is there a good guide on setting up the latest version without using a mac?The ones ive found are for old versions or you need a mac for
Have you actually used OS X?
you can just update a vm to sierra and use that, i used a yosemite vm initially
rutracker link posted in this thread. Use it to make a bootable USB.

I&#039;ve only had success using the method I described above. The flash drive had to have clover and some kexts, etc, so Unibeast works the best for me.
MacOS applications have the same issue that Microsoft is starting to make with WPF and &quot;Universal Apps,&quot; the applications themselves determine the styling of all of the window controls. It isn&#039;t to the same extreme on macOS that it is on Windows, but still, application themeing is pretty much impossible.
How did you learn Swift? This also goes for anyone to whom it might apply in the thread.





Which programming language is the best for developing AI?
Lisp
English
Python + numpy
OP wants to develop a sexbot.
html/css should do the trick


originally it was lispnow the industry is using python
C is for real cool folks tho

Punch cards
Best case scenario is that you&#039;ll use a ready-made library to train a CNN, so just learn whatever language that library is using.
Install gentoo
JavaScript. JS rules the world.
Depends, CPU or GPU?
Python, C++ for huge shit.
You need to understand the literature behind the complier.
Google Tensorflow
Any “AI” is going to be a big neural network running on a supercomputer, so your question is basically “what language is the best for programming supercomputers?”And the answer is basically CUDA or OpenCL for GPGPU, and FORTRAN, C or C++ (with OpenMP) for CPU
but i&#039;m using C for my project because fuck you
whatever google uses obviously
Visual Basic in an Excel spreadsheet.
Ada is the patrician choice for AI development
Python + Theano

try to understand the question before looking for the answer
OP here and you&#039;re actually correct
Another one here for JavaScript.The future is web-based, friends.
A true AI will self improve so it wont matter what language you use because eventually it&#039;ll make its own thats more efficient and fine tuned to its needs
An AI would need specific parameter how to be more &quot;efficient&quot; and &quot;fine tuned&quot;, which can only provided by humans.
OpenAI uses Python/Tensorflow
Anon you are being a pseudoprofound pseudointellectual here. Everybody knows that AI is advanced Machine Learning.
Visit #simwaifu @ irc.rizon.net

Possibly because neural is in the name? .. it has nothing to do with a brain
spice it up with some javascript for the low-level stuff like memory and what not
HTML + CSS
basically import libs written in C[++] and say you did it.
Or if you can find a stock LG D415 firmware somewhere for me that would be cool, but I cant find one.
bump

yea you do faggot.
Fuck OP, someone tell me a good music playback app for android.

Windows will be your best option
Threadly reminder that Windows 10 is so shitty there&#039;s still more Windows 7 users than 10 users, and 10% of people who just stopped upgrading after the shitshow that was Vista.
I think you misspelled Gentoo few times. Please be more careful.
Good thing i use FreeBSD
PS: good double numbers. Check mine :-)
Nice dubs
thanks! Thought no one will notice, because they are hidden as fuck xD
DEAD
the question is, how does it compare to Windows 4.9?

let me know what it&#039;s like
Yes but you&#039;ll never get rid of the creepy dude voice
Would have been nice trips, bro!
into the trash it goes
Solus is the new meme
Looking forward to 4.9 hitting Ubuntu MATE so I can finally run it on my desktop.
I personally use KDE myself.
I&#039;m waiting till it hits stable channel. I don&#039;t use mainline kernels.
Already running 4.9rc8 on my manjaro machineDon&#039;t understand how manjaro is even ahead of arch
i miss when arch was bleeding edgeyeah, nah.
KDE is not a hacker linux though. You can merely crack WEP wifi with kde
Nope. AMD wanted hundreds of lines commited to the kernel, which was denied.
KDE is a DE, not a kernel.
At least get it right. That code was for their unreleased architecture. 4.9 does have AMDGPU improvements.
I am an executive and I&#039;m running Linux KDE all the time.
i love lnuxGIMP rocks
It is still not good as good with hacking as windows is though. Windows has better hacker tools, like loic and shit.
i tried that once
You&#039;re not even using Windows? lol nice piece of shit operating system which you can&#039;t even play games on.
We have Krita now if you&#039;re not specifically into photos only.

you mean hundred thousand?
I own a ps4 for that.
Jesus Christ, nobody takes gentoo seriously anymore
no one has ever taken gentoo seriously.
Good thing its going to be the new LTS
Its -rc that doesn&#039;t really count, and you are using the testing repo
No because AMD is utter shit
Just use grsec already.

You mean the guy who&#039;s so autistic when you report a vulnerability he blocks you on twitter and on his personal website, then proceeds to whine about it on LWN like a full on sper/g/?
The New York Stock Exchange runs on Gentoo
idk, but 4.9 made my wifi card stop working so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯idk what changed, I did the upgrade same as usual (copy kernel config, make oldconfig, make), maybe one of the new options broke the wifi driver

if you have then maybe the kernel option was replaced, idk m8
I did, so yeah no idea really. To get it to work initially I had to add the name of the firmware I needed to a line to tell it to include it in the kernel (some change related to systemd or something made it so you need to include firmware in the kernel, not as separate files), maybe that part broke.
Switch to staging

godspeed
When upstream is autistic or has Oracle-tier ethics, the only policy is Full Disclosure
Alright so it&#039;s SystemD breaking stuff for no good reason again
No interesting changes compared to 4.8

no games
What is steam?
pixel indie garbage and half assed ports = no games
You&#039;re in denial.
wow all 10 of them!
8 of the 10 top played Steam games right now have Linux support
But you probably care more about feelings than reality, you fucking consumer.
DELET
and 90% of them are shitty indie games
The worst thing is that CIV 6 didn&#039;t go linux this time around. Valve is killing linux gaming by focusing on VR instead of steam machines. The hype is gone and developers are seeing low numbers and they&#039;re not porting their new games. ;_;
That&#039;s a crappy argument considering ALL of Steam is 90% shitty indie games
Steam machines were a thinly veiled threat to Microsoft trying to close down their platform, not a serious plan.
Pathetic damage control
Going to have the same fate as 3D movies and TV. Goddamn money grabbers shoving memes down our throat
Technically, the rejected code was for their HAL that is being shared with their Windows driver. Linus &amp; co. don&#039;t like HALs very much.
? It&#039;s simple math
Even macOS of all things has better games.
Yeah, &quot;damage control&quot;, also known as calling out your bullshit and you having exactly zero valid arguments.
Linux has only shitty games. Just stop.
A little bit unrelated, but today I got a kernel update and it&#039;s the fifth time of breaks compatibility with my wireless card. Every update it breaks and then it gets fixed in the next one. What the fuck are they doing messing with a 10-years old Ralink driver anyways?
Why do you even care about games that much?
Half of what you say is factually wrong, the other half is hot opinions.

But I am right in fact. Linux has no games.
The important part is that you believe it, right? Who cares if it&#039;s true.

But it is true. PS3 has no games either.




And?
b-but i just installed hyperdimention neptunia re;birth
This thread could be interesting, but it became the tsunami of shit.

Does FGLRX still work?
Why would you want to use it? It&#039;s deprecated. The open source drivers have worked better for years now.

If the open source drivers are still shit on 4.10 I will just stick to Debian Jessie.
Im not him
if I were to install this new kernel onto a debian stable machine, debian wouldn&#039;t have a stroke on me would it?
Awful. GNU/Linux? Moar like Gu-Ewwww slash Linux.
This is bait, right? You know Ubuntu is a GNU/Linux derivative and does use the Linux kernel, along with the GNU operating system, right? ._.
Which means you can always switch to a new kernel and it should Just Work.
How do i get the kernel 4.9 on arch? it didn&#039;t auto update?

What are you thoughts on the eclipse IDE?
I like IntelliJ better, but eclipse would be my second choice (at least for corporate/business java crap).
What Linux distribution does Area 51 use?
They use Windows
if they use linux, red hat
The Air Force actually maintains their own distribution with SELinux called Lightweight Portable Security.

aaaaand their security just went down the shitter
Ayy/Linux.
When in doubt install Adobe reader
gentoo, the only logical answer

Adobe reader is great when encountering software or hardware problems.  It&#039;s the best tech support analysis tool
They&#039;d use Windows or Debian
can someone help mei have a windows10 and i dont know how to find out the problem.

Because criminals are totally going to use a gun with a GPS tracker, right?
A lot of low-level gangbangers or independently operating criminals proudly carry around GPS trackers in the form of smartphones. I wouldn&#039;t expect most to be terribly smart.

They want to ruin antique weapons with that shit don&#039;t they?

I can see the usefulness if this is on one of your self defense weapons, but the end of the video implies that they want to legislate it into all guns. Even if it&#039;s easy to disable, it would drive up the costs of manufacture and make the shooting range a pain.
So how long until someone streams murders where the chat controls who pulls the trigger? Thanks Buzzfeed!
Liberals are stupid. Just have full coverage of CCTV with gun shot detectors and live monitors like they secretly have in major cities near critical zones all over the world.
But I mean I can&#039;t imagine someone hasn&#039;t made a red room where people spam some button within a timeframe to decide who dies first.
They&#039;re absolutely fucking stupid if they think this would ever work to catch criminals.
I&#039;m fairly certain if you discharge you will have the same effect
Kek
Why not just force all niggers to wear GPS tracking bracelets? Problem solved.
I didn&#039;t need that boner right now
The problem with liberals isn&#039;t that they want to track us.It&#039;s just fucking bad engineering. And that&#039;s the problem with liberals. They&#039;re not engineers, so they love overly complicated, fancy gimmicky bullshit.
What&#039;s up with the stars?

O fug

So from what I was able to understand, the primary method of communication for this device is through a cellular connection. Even if this were an irremovable part of nearly all available guns, couldn&#039;t the signal be easily disrupted/blocked by faraday shield of any kind? Meaning I could practically wrap the thing in fucking tinfoil and go apeshit without anyone knowing.
fuck this earth I want out

This is so painfully retarded and irrational.  Why is it that people with no practical experience in this issues always come up with the most moronic solutions... usually to problems that don&#039;t even exist.
Putting a digitally controlled lock on the gun doesn&#039;t seem like it would be super difficult, and it&#039;s more that nobody&#039;s bothered doing something like that.  The real hurdle is the cloud computing system that can recognize who the gun is pointed at and evaluate if they are a criminal risk.

This will at least control civilian possession of gun. Thugs who obtain gun from illegal sources can do what they want I guess.

Tweet the kill score
It&#039;s like fucking nothing.
Is it a meme or real?So, console gayming will be not an option anymore.
There is no advantage over getting 120-144Hz monitors over regular 60Hz.Stop going into long winded discussions about it. It&#039;s a gigantic waste of money for memes.
Don&#039;t listen to retards OP, better specs is just that BETTER.
okay.
Yes they are worth it, I have 1440p 144hz and a 1080 60hz next to it. the difference between them is vast.
Your graphics card will throttle and skip frames anyways.
144hz user here. I love it and could never imagine going back to 60hz. You notice a difference in everything you do.
If you also do own a console, you will never play that again.
why?
It sure felt good, my man.
what is the maximum refresh rate achieved even in experimental/lab conditions?
Too bad I&#039;m a poorfag and can&#039;t afford a 144 HZ IPS display
It feels smoother. However if you get used to it 60hz looks like torture.
I know it&#039;s vidyagaems bullshit but the difference between low input delay + 144fps on pc compared to a regular HD TV is very noticeable when playing rocket league. Yeah, not everyone will be playing a console on a standard TV but the average person definitely will be.
Nah 75hz is good enough.  What kind of game are you going to get a constant 120 fps on?
I got a 144hz monitor now, used to have a 95hz crt  as my first one, then &quot;upgraded&quot; to a LCD 60hz screen.. and now this. i could not imagine going back to 60hz. the difference is that great.
Overall I would have no problem using either a 60hz or 144hz monitor. They are both vastly inferior to a 120hz ULMB monitor.
Indeed, too bad.
Ah, I hate these decisions.259 bucks: 144hz, freesync 48hz-144hz, LFC
He&#039;s probably going to play competitive no-fun-allowed games.
Like? Quake live? Does anyone even play that anymore
minecraft xD
I&#039;ve got a 144Hz monitor, if I try really hard, I might be able to tell, but 60Hz is plenty smooth enough. I wouldn&#039;t recommend it.

144hz is only halfway to what might be the beginning of the limits of human visual perception.
If you&#039;re playing something like CS:GO, RL, Overwatch or some other fast game, I&#039;d recommend it. If you&#039;re playing other casual games, I&#039;d still recommend it, but not as strongly if money is an issue.
with my 2x1080s quite a few.
Not all of us use our integrated thinkpad graphics
No, like CS:GO, Overwatch. Games that has too much going on too fast. These monitors are aimed for that people (mostly), because the graphics aren&#039;t too fancy, so they can easily reach 200fps with everything cranked up to max with a decent GPU even in 4k, and at 144Hz, they can see a bit more information that might save the game.
The question for me is whether the upgrade is worth  the extra 100bucks.
Even movies look a bit smoother because its a multiple of 24
Is that Xonotic?
yep
it&#039;s not as big of a difference as i would&#039;ve hoped desu. i have a 1440p 144hz monitor and it&#039;s not a huge difference at all. slightly smoother, yes, but not twice as smooth (noticeably).
fuck 4chan for making t.b.h correct to desu.
Definitely worth it then
If money isnt an issue go for 144hz , depending on gpu either go for one with free or gsync
Unless you play exclusively slow stuff like Overwatch the difference will be night and day.
After switching to 144 hz I can&#039;t go back to old motion blur while trying to move the camera in any game that requires spotting enemies. I almost forgot how good it was on CRTs, now I can actually see something while moving the camera nonstop. I know it&#039;s a side effect, but it turned out to be much more important for me than HFR.
You can tell a pretty big difference just from looking at the mouse cursor on the screen, in games it&#039;s way better too, tracking enemies with automatic weapons is su much easier.I guess maybe if you want to play stuff mostly for fancy graphics and don&#039;t care that much about performance I could understand not caring about 144hz. Personally I usually just turn everything down to achieve high FPS as I care more about having a smooth performance than anything else.

It&#039;s worthwhile in my opinion. You don&#039;t necessarily have to hit 144Hz for it to be noticeable either, if you&#039;ve got an eye for high framerates every bit helps.I actually upgraded to a 1440p 165Hz G-Sync monitor from my old 1080p 144Hz, and while I&#039;m rarely running shit at 165fps, it&#039;s nice to have the added headroom for whenever I can consistently achieve it.
Lol I have a 1080, stay poor
you&#039;re going to get diminishing returns, It depends principally on how much you care about it and if you play twitch shooters.
I&#039;ve had the same 120hz monitor for almost 10 years now (Samsung 2233rz).  It makes a huge difference and I will probably never by another sub-100hz monitor for myself again

And now have 144hz IPS for a year.
120-144 is so beautiful to look at.  I&#039;d sacrifice graphical fidelity for frames.  You feel it immediately in fps games with a quick look side to side.  60 becomes ugly.  I feel higher frame rate is easier on the eyes if you have a problem with headaches, maybe thats just me
Honestly I don&#039;t think they&#039;re worth the money but they definitely give you a huge advantage on &quot;gayming&quot;. So much it&#039;s actually unfair.
This is actually a lie, at least for first-person games. You get used to the smoothness and stop noticing it after a while, but it&#039;s a massive advantage when it comes to precision and aim correction.
60 at 144hz still better than at 60hz, not to mention how delay changes.
even desktop feels sluggish
visually no, I disagree.  There may be something to your argument in regards to input delay but I can&#039;t confirm that
I have ordered the one with 144hz refresh rate now through amazon.That said I actually still have the quality Iiyama CRT here, which I could use. But its electricity hungry and as far as I can remember it was really straining for my eyes.
Once you go bl...144hz you can never turn back.
60FPS won&#039;t necessarily be synchronized with 60hz. 144hz guarantees that you will always have the latest possible frame on your screen.
visually yes, ever tried scrolling text at 144hz? or webpages?
That&#039;s not 60hz.  That&#039;s 144hz.  Your desktop environment and most web browsers can handle that, try playing a game fullscreen capped at 60, there is no visual difference
not a meme, big difference in games
Is it really guaranteed though?  Or just on average, you get better responsiveness.  To be precise
Now I have to use my TV as a monitor while my great Iiyama CRT rots away :(
at 60hz tearing is unbearable even if fps is 60 capped

It&#039;s like you not even trying.
both, most 144hz monitors have input lag of less than 4ms
While I would never buy a monitor less than 120hz since I have the option, I can still enjoy playing consoles on a 60hz TV.
I have looked up the listed 1050Ti cards and they all have DVI outputs, atleast the ones sold in Europe.

native panel refresh rate is always better
scrub git gud and get yourself some liquid helium cooled superconducting shit
The most popular games hit 120fps like nothing. Battlefield 1, Overwatch, CSGO, Minecraft. It&#039;s usually the more underground shit that is harder to hit 120fps on.
but you can&#039;t see it=&gt; it doesn&#039;t matter=&gt;no need to enable vsync or other crap
some programs just aren&#039;t set up to redraw at variable rates.  Your monitor will refresh and display the next frame, but a given program may only redraw every 1/30 of a second and there is nothing you can do about it.
Naw. If you&#039;re watching 60fps on a high framerate monitor it&#039;ll appear smoother in 120hz mode than 144hz mode because the frame timing will be consistent with the monitor in 120hz mode.
Yes, but mine has DVI-D, which doesn&#039;t send an analog signal, so a DVI to VGA adapter would be useless. I&#039;m either buying a 400 eurobucks digital to analog converter or I&#039;m shit out of luck.
the only games that glitch at HFR with this unlocked are a couple of crappy/broken console ports
TRSv9sQ8
In some cases it can be easier from an engineering perspective to have your program do things at set intervals between frames (physics updates, AI computations, etc.).  That&#039;s why some programs are fixed, and others aren&#039;t
Difference is HUGE, if you have the money just go for it. With a 1080 you will pull 100fps + for most games and for csgo/quake its an even bigger improvement. Just beware that going back to 60hz after using a 144hz will look like shit.
Fox and the grapes: the post.
if you show twice as many frames the latest each frame can possibly be and still show is cut in half.
What we really need are 240+ Hz strobing monitors, but that&#039;s not happening anytime soon due to LCD being somewhat shit and even DP 1.3/1.4 not having enough bandwidth to do that at respectable resolutions and color depths.
Is that the ULMB or something else? Because I&#039;ve got that a ULMB mode on my monitor and it&#039;s absolute shit-tier.
I guess you can blink LEDs thousands of times a second. Response time starts to play a role in this quite quickly.
People were choosing 60Hz when it was the best IPS option, but now you don&#039;t have to choose between IPS and 144Hz at 1440p.
Haven&#039;t tried refresh rates over 60Hz, highest refresh rate I&#039;ve ever experienced was the HTC Vive&#039;s 90Hz but that is not easily comparable with a monitor.
it kills brightness and contrast as far as I know
It&#039;s not placebo, it&#039;s not necessary. A nice feature to have but not every piece of software supports it and you have to drive those framerates fine. Also lower picture quality for its price.
Does yes for brightness yes but the improvement in motion clarity due to low persistence is pretty amazing. If you play in a dark room, it&#039;s amazing. ULMB quality varies a lot.
Not to mention how much nicer normal desktop usage is. I&#039;ll be buying another 144hz for my second monitor because they&#039;re so cheap now. Dat smooth cursor
i gotta stop posting from a phone

Personally I have a harder time seeing a difference once I&#039;m up over 115-120 FPS or so but I don&#039;t doubt that some people are able to appreciate even higher FPS.  The jet pilot report should be a benchmark for what is humanly possible.
I use mine for retroarch + black frame insertiondamn it looks so good in motion though.
That is all.
The human eye can only see 24 fps per second.
Imo dont buy it yet, also it wont help you much in csgo.Wait until 4k hdr 3ms ips 25inch for under $300 is a thing before buying i think
You understand neither reaction time and the overhead caused by monitor signal processing, response time and refresh rate or the benefits of a low persistence, low latency display with high frame rate.

Considering aiming happens over periods numbering in the hundreds of milliseconds, this results in a significant improvement in the time it takes to confidently fire. Alternately, if you are firing after only 200ms of aiming regardless, it&#039;s a bonus to the accuracy of your adjustment, as you received twice as much useful information during this period.

it&#039;s just 12 fps per second for every eye
thats out bar hdr i think. why would you get 240hz thouhg? i have a similar resolution on my 4k tv that i cant tell much of a difference with
It IS smoother. If money is a concern, I would say that it is not worth it for the price.
I feel like the refresh rate would be so high that you wouldn&#039;t need a tearing solution like gsync or freesync because the tearing would be so imperceptible. Also, black frame insertion might actually work without giving you a massive headache like on 120/144hz monitors.
False unless the test subject is really bad.   People that have the ability to process what they&#039;re seeing will be interpreting double the information and reacting based off of that.
6 fps in the case of 3d
well i use black frame with retroarch and it looks quite nice. However its too expensive and not available in monitor sizes with low latency
That test was in relation to viewing high contrast images (e.g. a red dot appearing for 1/300 of a second on a black background). Actual perceived vision is closer to 150-200 fps for making out images and words.
yeah, you would just need a fucking BlueGene/Q to play minesweeper instead
If we can play Doom at 4k 60fps we can play it at 240hz 1080p.
tl;dr I will never go back to 60hz, even just for doing everything outside of gaming
I have tried both, yes 144hz is no meme, its so nice and silky smooth. But personally I had the choice of 1440p 60hz or 1080p 144hz, I opted for 1440p 60hz and I&#039;m happy with my choice. (Apart from bullshit text scaling)
There are far better ergonomics methods to prevent eyestrain than adjusting your hardware.
your eyes can&#039;t see more than 24hz anyaway
FRIENDLY REMINDER TO TURN OFF G-SYNC AND TURN ON ULMB INSTEAD FOR YOUR VIDEO GAMES&amp;height=0
If you&#039;ve got a 144Hz monitor, what framerate would you recommend opting for ULMB over G-Sync?
it was a worthwhile decision for me, and money well spent considering the frequency I use my pc
120Hz, that&#039;s what worked best for my ASUS VG248QE
Doesn&#039;t work like this.
with ulmb on it&#039;s crystal clear, even in motion.
As high as it goes so up to 120 Hz. You are limited to fixed refresh rates with ULMB and higher is always better. It&#039;s beneficial to run games at as high frame rates as possible(way above 120 fps) to avoid the latency overhead caused by fixed monitor refresh and frame timings. If you can&#039;t maintain high fps, the tearing and repeated frames at 120 Hz ULMB can be quite annoying. G-Sync(or similar) is a valid choice there. Up to you, try it out.

/g/oyim keep falling for it
ok
Very real. Useless outside of video games.
Good /g/oy
Don&#039;t reply to baits.
What did he mean by this ?
I upgraded from 60Hz and 100Hz recently and there&#039;s a massive difference in smoothness.  Games look so much nicer and feel more responsive.

So keep in mind that although 120hz+ is really good, 75hz is still a massive improvement over 60hz because of diminishing returns. I&#039;d say pick your monitor based on what frame rates you can get. You either have to have super hardware or an old game to get over 120 fps.

To get motion as sharp as CRT your 144hz monitor needs a strobing backlight mode, or else you will have smooth blurry motion
Who ever writes that its a huge meme is either a poorfag or some old fucker with terrible vision.
ITT: Post-purchase rationalizationIf you notice difference in pic related then you have autism
either you&#039;re baiting or you should get your eyes checked
If it&#039;s modern gaming, then just get a 60hz, if it&#039;s light gaming, then get the 144hz, your eyes will thank you. Then again, you do whatever you feel is right.
5. Have a mental disability and shitpost daily just to stir up shit and annoy others.
Saying the eye can&#039;t see more than 24/30/60 fps is classic trolling in the spirit of glass being a liquid and moving very slowly. &quot;The eyes don&#039;t see in frames&quot; are parroting retards who read that 100fps article.
All I see is damage control. It&#039;s a fact that human eye doesn&#039;t perceive any difference with FPS higher than 60. Do you also use magic stones for your audiophile setup, retard?

I switched from a 60Hz to a 144Hz and it is fucking magic, literally. It is so much smoother. I play csgo regularly, so it is an advantage especially in this game. I&#039;d say it&#039;s totally worth it. Though, you need a nice gear to play games on at least 1080p on &gt;120fps to make the best out of your specs+monitor.
Go perform your voodoo stone magic.
Basic /g/, yet again using terms wrong. I guess I could classify as an audiophile. I&#039;m pretty interested in the subject of audio reproduction and know things. I&#039;m not into voodoo and stones are not audio.
Thank (You)
3kliksphilip did a reaction time test with 3 different monitors.i8cMu3DI&amp;ab_channel=3kliksphilip
this. Im so sad native 75Hz is rare in bigger screens, the 15 frames/second improvement makes everything look so much better
For a production monitor, I&#039;d assume around 360hz, but realistically more like 240hz on consumer stuff. That said, the benefit decays logarithmically, so going from 60 to 120 is going to be a much bigger difference than from 120 to 360, were it to exist, so there&#039;s not much point.
1) have fun waiting until never and 2) you want OLED not IPS.
It is better, but the advertising and pricing they use is deliberately intended to shaft stupid people. If you can afford it, go for it, but it&#039;s definitely not necessary by any means and will not negatively impact your life.
This. Gamer gear is pointless and it&#039;s users should be jailed for white privilege.
I think it&#039;s only dumb to pay extra cash for memesync monitors, a cheaper 144hz 1ms is going to be more than sufficiently smooth.
An opinion you can trust.
I have, I don&#039;t really notice a difference above 85Hz or soYMMV though, I&#039;ve heard great things from friends who have them
I got a VG245H a few weeks ago, the difference between it and my 2 60hz monitors was instantly noticeable. I&#039;d get another 144 based on the mouse smoothness alone.
60 to 120 hz is noticeable unless your really that slow in the head that you see 60hz as 30 hz
no regrets
Unexpected stimuli is where you get the huge delay of 1/4 and you have to work out what you&#039;re looking at before you can reasonably proceed.
make sure you won&#039;t get eyecancer in the long run by buying a monitor with antiglare, flickerfree and bluelight reduction features.
The difference is noticeable, but if your playing WoW and LIL or something it really does not matter for how much you pay. Only thing I could see of benefit is if your an FPS gaymer (CS, BF, etc.).
144hz is definitely worth 200$
This alone is beautiful for a monitor regardless. 144hz is just icing on that cake imo.
Speaking of which I just bought a refurbished MG279Q, how fucked am I?
No advantage for reaction times in multiplayer games I think he means. I think it would help see things tho
So if I get a 1070 do I need to get a 144hz monitor with gsync to really benefit?  I want the 1070 over the amd480 for that extra performance. I&#039;d be playing 1080 60hz now then new monitor in the coming months (1080p 144hz or 1440p 144hz.). Do I really need a gsync or freesync monitor for 144hz gaming?
Only if you play twitchy competitive FPS, it&#039;s like using a car in a bike race you can tell when someones using shitty hardware
My BenQ XL2411z did need color calibration out of the box though
Not worth getting a new monitor just to try and play better, but if you&#039;re upgrading anyway, go for it.
if you are a man and will use your screen for work, then there&#039;s no point over a 144hz monitor. just make sure it&#039;s IPS.
Acer XG270HU owner here. Hello cousin! Want to go bowling some time?
Gee I don&#039;t know, we&#039;ll optimized games?
unless you play fps games its a pointless luxurybut there are no fps games worth playing, so just forget it
Yes because men like mouse cursors, windows, and scrolling which is basically a slide show
I play mainly single player games. Some chivalry, battlefield games. I&#039;m just undecided between a 1070 or amd 480. Not a money thing but a futureproof factor. Dx12 support and freesync /gsync.
60hz is literally obsoleted garbage and if you use one, I feel sorry for being so poor.
It&#039;s not noticeable under 60hz.
Well, technically it could help your performance in some games, like fps&#039; and simulators, but I wouldn&#039;t worry about that unless you&#039;re already in the top 1%.
Doesn&#039;t matter then, you&#039;re playing casual babby shit
Don&#039;t play much online except for those. Does this offend you?
No, I&#039;m just disappointed in you
Cause I don&#039;t play online twitch shooters like you?
It also only cost me $500 instead of $800 for the IPS version (which has a lot of backlight bleed complaints)

144hz monitor will give you about a 5% boost in accuracy in most fpses. It&#039;s pretty well proven at this point. While it&#039;s not much in any individual fight, over the course of a match, the extra damage really adds up. There&#039;s a reason why high level players use one once and then never switch back. People have been used to consoles where you have a wireless controller + slow tv + wireless internet + barely 30fps @ 720p.
People talk about TN like they haven&#039;t seen a TN panel in 10 years. They are appropriate for everything but content creation.
A-TW &gt; *
is a glossy screen required for IPS?
Why pay to get rid of it? If IPS glow is a problem (off center in dark room) switch to VA or its derivatives for better blacks.
If one of those is having to pay over $2k for a monitor and it doesn&#039;t bother you then why not?
You barely notice the difference. Sure if you open some motion blur test program the difference is massive, but you won&#039;t notice it the rest of the time. Waste of money. Get 4K or something, or one with nicer colours.
I MUCH prefer my friends 1440p 144hz screen, the high Hz is no joke. 100+ fps makes playing games more enjoyable, ULMB actually makes fast paced games easier, 4K just made games look awkward and still limited them at 60fps (when I turn down settings to even hit that)
I&#039;ve never actually seen a 4K screen. Maybe my eyes are just fucked, the difference between 144Hz and 60Hz is something that&#039;s nice, but that I could definitely live without, especially considering how expensive it is.

Sure it is. Where did you pull that number out of?
Is this bait? I think this is bait. Have your (you) you meme&#039;ing fuck.
3fps if you&#039;re actually IRL since real life is 4d
I fucking hope that Vega won&#039;t be a failure, because I have bought a freesync monitor.And don&#039;t come with the Fiji series. I don&#039;t want to have power hungry monsters, which are also loud and hot.
I play FPS and Rhythm games competitively and have won money doing so. I find 40 fps is perfectly fine in let&#039;s say The Witcher 3 but i can&#039;t stand dropping below 120 in anny arena style shooter.
Well, I mean, he&#039;s not exactly wrong?
Im personally waiting till somone (preferably amd) makes a card that can max out any game 1440p at 120hz. anything beyond that will have pretty noticeable diminishing returns

What&#039;s the average IQ of 4chan? Why do I still come here?
But its technically correct..?
I also bet somebody I could play a rock band 3 setlist on expert
1080ti will
120 is way better for everything you do on your computer. What I love about it is how smooth it makes browsing the web. It&#039;s also a huge improvement for games. I&#039;ve played on 30, 60, and 120. I&#039;d go for 120/144 everytime over a higher resolution.
You answered your own question
For everything else, nah.
My 290x cost me more than your 1080 goes for.

3d platforming is an underdone genre. I got hundreds of hours out of it.
It&#039;s totally worth it, probably one of the beat 3D platformers ever made.
I honestly didn&#039;t notice a huge difference.  There is one, but it&#039;s minor.  There&#039;s almost as big of a difference between 45 FPS - 60 FPS as there is 60 FPS - 120 FPS in regards to frametimes.I run 60 Hz with GSYNC now.  I&#039;m of the opinion that high refresh rate is a meme started by companies that invested tons of money into 3D and are looking for a return on all the R&amp;D that went into high refresh rate panels.
- 144FPS is much smoother.
I&#039;m disapointed in you mirroring the same hand instead of getting an actual left and right hand.
I stare at a VG248QE at 144hz albeit with a frame limiter at 60 fps for gaymenz. It really makes web browsing more fluid and that&#039;s only marginally better. still could go back to 60hz if need be.
someones projecting
this
Its pretty good for the observers. For the users though, it depends on the use case
god does /g/ even has mods anymore
This thread hurts... maybe I should avoid comming to 4chan
maybe some day I will meet that one person who&#039;ll say &quot;mmeh&quot;
adaptive frame syncing (gsync or freesync) is more important than high frame rate, but why not both?I have a 144hz gsync and honestly it is the best thing I ever bought for playing games. It&#039;s nicer than getting a new gpu (though you want a gpu that can actually do the frame rate. I can&#039;t really do above 60 in new games with my 980 but old games get 144 and it&#039;s beautiful. gsyncmakes it less of a big deal tho)
Because adaptive sync doesn&#039;t work with ULMB so for me it&#039;s just 120 Hz and ULMB at very high frame rates.
1080p samsung quantum dot 144hz VA deep black panel with superior contrastIm gaming on next gen, probly run star citizen at 1080p next year, and arma 3 / esports. What do i choose?
ULMB is pretty good too. It&#039;s unfortunate that it doesn&#039;t work with gsync but I don&#039;t see how it possibly could. Hopefully some smart minds at nvidia are on it...
Just an issue how quickly you can get the burst to activate on the monitor side.
Only one pinky ring.
1440p 144hz IPS an option?
Watch dogs 2 :^)
144 hz, 1400p IPS 27&quot;
With a 144hz monitor I went from silver 4 to Nova master and am still ranking up in less than 3 weeks
Life isn&#039;t just memes
If you&#039;re going to sacrifice resolution for the blacks and for absolute shit samsung support you shouldn&#039;t even be looking at high refresh monitors
4k60 master race
No, obviously they aren&#039;t a meme. If you think getting one will make you git gud at a a game, then you&#039;re a retard.
At 1440p I render more K&#039;s per second than you
i have a bigger screen and no jaggies.

But you render less pixels more slowly than I do
Of course you have no Jags you spent all your money on 4K you dummy while I stuck with 1080p and bought the new f type
Any competitive games like CSGO,mobas,overshit, play smoother and you  react quicker. Specially csgo
you mean making payments. how&#039;s that 800 dollar a month payment feel?
But you can play games at any resolution that&#039;s why they&#039;re games and not videos
with its complete playerbase in the screenshot
Ok now I finally understand the point in higher Hz. I hate this in games and it gives Me motionsickness unless I&#039;m atlest 35-45 cm away from the monitor or more..
And yeah, under 60Hz ULMB still gives you a headache (85hz imo too) but 120hz ULMB just look super clear, I like it more than both 144hz and gsync
Yes the 3D wih glasses 3D movies where more impressive then the 60FPS nonsense.
The latest rehash of 3D (VR) relies almost entirely on extreme framerates and nearly zero lag
90fps requirement for vive btw
What about the latency?Seems like shooting yourself in the foot compared to sticking with a 144hz TN 1ms monitor.
Placebo effect the posts.
It&#039;s no 120hz meme, but least it&#039;s not the 30hz meme my friends deal with on consoles
Dear /g/, explain to me why people get to Global rank in CSGO with 60hz monitors? Its because youre shit and think you will get an actual advantage (you wont) from that 144hz monitor!I always point out this when I meet some new people irl and talk about gaming, they always get triggered so hard.
They&#039;d do better on 144hz.
Behead those who insult memes
They don&#039;t need to do better, they are literally at the pinnacle of non pro gaming. So you are saying that they should waste their money?
Reality is they are poor Brazilians who can&#039;t afford it.


Live with it slowbros.
So 5 fps is good for you?

No, they are filthy Brazilian peasants who make do with what they have. If they could upgrade to 144hz, they would. They don&#039;t because they can&#039;t. That&#039;s the reality.
I have a monitor that runs on 60mhz.Does that mean I&#039;ll gain 12fps?
The general consensus is: HUGH REFRESH RATE IS A MEME IT DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING EXCEPT IT MAKES THINGS SMOOTHER WHICH IS SOMETHING
you can get 72Hz out of most &quot;60Hz&quot; monitors
No you&#039;ll actually gain 12000000fps
So games will show 72fps then?
Basically it means that under 60fps is cool now
Yea I get that, but why does it say 72hz then when it actually will be 60
But it is so pointless, it is literally restricted to the top 5% in the population that will ever see real benefit. And then its really only pros whou would need it.... Its wasted money, get a better gpu and max out those games instead!
fucking hate playing games at 60-100fps now, I require 144 to not rage at the choppyness
In either case, unless you can &quot;overclock&quot; your monitors refresh rate, you&#039;re stuck at 60fps and everything up until this post makes me believe 60fps works fine with freesync
It&#039;s very easy to see 30-60fps, during gaming I think anything over 100fps is fine, but if I try I can definitely see a 20fps change all the way up to 144hz
I did max out my games, what else would I do with my 90fps?
anyone can see a benefit even just at the desktop. There&#039;s a large difference. It&#039;s not going to make you a number 1 pro gamer all by itself but it will make a noticeable difference in your game at any level.
Though without FreeSync I can only select 60Hz. That&#039;s why I find it weird. Will I be able to actually use 72Hz once FreeSync is enabled? Meaning true 72fps?
You&#039;d have to fuck with your monitor (not the gpu) to get past that
Higher refresh rates reduce reaction time and probably increase your chances of tracking and hitting fast moving targets.
Alright, sort of bad to state it in the specifications like that then. I was convinced it will have 72hz.
I mean overclockable monitors do exist and that freesync one you have might, I never tried that though because the term itself sounds dumb
spotted the women
Hm na I wouldn&#039;t feel comfortable messing around with it
Plebs actually believe this.
Did you even set it to 144 Hz in settings? There is no way it is just &quot;barely&quot; noticeable.
Asking quake friends and comparing numbers. LG numbers almost instantly go up about 5%.
He&#039;s probably watching YouTube videos to test it
look at a 144hz monitor for an hour then look at a normal monitor or just add a fps cap! you won&#039;t believe it when you feel your eyes start to burn as they look at anything below 120hz! and the best part is that it&#039;s permeant! Enjoy your new found addiction to high refresh rates that will drive you to lowering graphic settings on most of your games and buying the most expensive GPUs on the market to not just meet the requirements of your screen, but the endless desire of your soulless spoiled eyes!
Is that a true story anon?

Why is Linux riddled with nonfree software?Is it just lazyness?
it&#039;s hard to RE hardware so you can write a driver for it. things like graphics cards are very complex, and other things like wifi drivers are probably not as hard but easy to make a mistake on
They have a very strict code policy that&#039;s why it&#039;s easier to compile shitty code into a blob then making it FOSS.
Because only Theo de Raadt is manly enough to go through with free drivers to the point of removing bluetooth support entirely just to make a point.
This is the hero free software needs
It would be too hard to reverse engineer them all + even if the source code was open the toolchain used to produce the binary might not be
Ded OS, ded lyfe.
what a madman. I refuse to believe that he&#039;s that insane. that has to be a troll.
If it&#039;s not auditable and open, it doesn&#039;t belong in OpenBSD
but you know what, it&#039;s a fucking niche server OS so the loss of BT is probably not a big deal since no one will use it anyway.
if it doesn&#039;t run in your cpu/memory who cares?  stallman is wrong this time.  use all the firmwares you want.  this is not a blob.  blobs are shit that want to actually run in kernel space. enough.
uninterrupted 6 month releases for two decades fucktard
He means nobody will use BT, because it&#039;s a server OS and servers don&#039;t need BT
no one uses openssh
i stand corrected.
Firmware is the software on the hardware itself. Drivers are how the computer interacts with hardware. The blobs are drivers.
Install linux-libre then
Daily reminder that Debian is the only relevant distro that keeps blobs away from kernel.
I guess people who use OpenBSD are already used to making this sort of sacrifices?
100% listen to this guy faggots
no they just don&#039;t care about bluetooth and no one is paying them to care.  it may be fun to make it more complicated, but it&#039;s this simple.
What does /g/ think of the other distros in the list?
He&#039;s actually somewhat more reasonable than rms. He allows firmware images to be used by drivers he just doesn&#039;t allow his kernel or OS to be proprietary. He asks the company for the source code for their drivers and he gets a rejection he just reverses the drivers and makes one himself or someone else in the community does. OpenBSD devs also straight up tell you to do it yourself if you ask for hardware support. They&#039;ll help you if you post source code but they wont just bend to demands
fsf doesn&#039;t recommend debian because they have an optional non-default non-free repository. a lot of it is just fonts and codecs.  over the years most of it has fallen into irrelevancy but its still there.
No, just incompetence.
because &quot;free&quot; software is a meme. fuck off.
(((Free software))) is controlled by a kike who wants communism to take over the world. True freedom is to allow proprietary software.
(((Free software))) is plain communism pushed by a fat commie who coincidentally is also a KIKE.

Ignore the list, only RMS-tier zealots care enough to get on there, and there aren&#039;t enough people like that around to maintain a good distro.  So either they take most of their packages from a normal distro (in which case you might as well use that one instead) or the distro sucks.
The linux kernel doesn&#039;t ship with any closed source drivers...
You don&#039;t care anyway so troll elsewhere. DIAF.
firmwares aren&#039;t blobs.  they do not touch your cpu or memory.  if you want freedom respecting firmwares, you want free hardware.
fuck off /pol/.
A lot of the codecs in there will become free software in the coming years because the patents on them will expire. H.264/AVC is getting up there. MP3 may already technically be free but I&#039;m not sure if anyone knows for certain yet.
I agree. I appreciate all the nice open source tools but I can see why video games and media production software need to stay closed source
Is a notebook without a full hd display really that bad?
Yes. No portable computer can compare to a separate 24&quot;+ screen.
My old T410 from 2010 has a 1440x900 screen. I just upgraded to an Acer Swift 3 and it was just shy of $1000 with tax and has a 1080p screen. Quite a nice upgrade for productivity.
for a &lt;12&quot; screen on a cheapish notebook maaaaybe.  and it can&#039;t be some TN horseshit
Still, /g/ always told me that 13&quot; 1080p was a bad thing
displays with less than 200 ppi are shit and there is no reason for them to exist in the current year
Anything over 15&quot; with under 1080p is bad
1080p would be nice, but 768p isn&#039;t intolerable.
IPS doesn&#039;t always mean better than TN.
I have a 13.3&quot; 1366 x 768, going 1080p would be a great improvement, but for what i do with it (typing), its not necessary. Going IPS would be much more helpful, because the angles on my TN panel are absolute trash.
no, faggots here enjoy bashing 1366x768 while it is actually fine for &lt;15 &quot; they just want a larger res to compensate for their dick
Is 2560x1440 good on 24&quot;?I was planning on getting an Asus VX24AH
1080p in a 13 inch is too small for me. I could make everything bigger but I might as well use a smaller resolution.
Yes. There&#039;s not enough space to properly open two windows side by side so they&#039;re terrible for productivity imo.
For some reason people here are really particular about keyboards because muh productivity. But completely rationalise awful 768p TN panels, you know the thing you will be looking at 99.9% of the time while using the computer.
anything below 1440p is dogshit
Shit keyboards give me RSI.
i have 1600 x 900 and screen looks really good.  Sure, having more pixels would make it better for having more windows on the screen but it&#039;s a 15.6 inch screen and I don&#039;t have young virgin eyes and shit would probably be too small to read if it wasn&#039;t scaled back up.  so I&#039;m happy with better performance/longer battery life on my cuckbook.shit looks great to me but I was computing in the MS DOS era so take that with a grain of salt
Brb downloading childhood
I got a Lenovo 15ASZ (I think it&#039;s that) £300, 1080p screen, it&#039;s awesome, only problem is shit battery life which I fixed with a modded battery compartment so I can just switch out the lithium cells
768p is more than enough on the go you fucking autist
I wonder why
I also have a piece of Junk Advent with a 15.6 at 1366 x 768 which is fucking NASTY.
this, the resolution doesn&#039;t matter. the size does
The point of laptops, is to be able to use them &quot;on the go&quot;. So a good high res screen is essential if you want to be &quot;productive&quot; on the go.
how will a higher res help your workflow? everyone&#039;s workflow is different so arguing about this is pointless. I value battery over resolution, 12 hours SOT with a 9 cell battery 1366x768 Elitebook at 7 pounds
It literally only has 2 lithium cells as opposed to the normal 6 or 8 other laptops have, or a nice custom shaped like pack
t. 1366x768 user.
Which one do you prefer?
i cant tell the differencei must have very bad ears
But humans can&#039;t hear above 20000 Hz.
the highest quality possible coming in.But really, I see the difference in waveform quality more than I hear the difference
hmm...
8 bit, 11025 Hz, mono
Still made me reply
also I think bit depth is more important than bitrate, but only for editing, I never noticed a difference in straight audio from 24-32 bitJust find the most original distribution of the recording you can, it&#039;s not like anybody except wubfags are putting out 32bit 192khz music anyways
Anything above is overkill unless the source files are actually of higher sample rate and 99% aren&#039;t
I know some random games and programs may have a tendency to crash if you put the setting higher than 24 bit 48kHz so I&#039;m rolling with that.
What do I have to lose by setting it to 192kHz? It&#039;s the quality that leading recording studios work at.
You have nothing to lose if all your programs are compatibilities with it, but don&#039;t expect to gain anything if you&#039;re not editing or have 192Khz sources
Working at 192khz is not publishing at 192khz
Why not release a 192kHz version? The technology is already there.
Because it&#039;ll make the file big and possibly limit which codecs you can export in, and that 90% of people won&#039;t tell a difference, and 9% of people won&#039;t care
But like I said, lots of 100% in-the-box productions like modern electronic music artists like to publish in the highest quality possible just because there&#039;s little to no actual recording being done
I&#039;m sure Blu-ray can handle it.
2hz
Yeah, let&#039;s just wait for producers to realize that selling songs on physical media is totally profitable

Dude, I would totally buy music on Blu-ray.
Please make a recording so we can witness this glory.
You can also high-cut your music at 800hz and bitcrush the rest into low res 8 bit music for the same effect
l-Blu-Ray-Pure-Audio/products/794/
10% is insignificant, even if we cant tell the difference, coming down from 192 or 96 by a interger division to 48k must make more sense
441.khz is popular because that&#039;s what CDs used (and CDs use AIFF I believe?)
16 bit and 24 bit no differnce
But yeah, at any normal 44khz+ audio the difference between 16-24 bit depth is little to none (especially with dithering)
Actually now I&#039;m legitimately curious, at what bit depth/sample rate would a recording &quot;surpass&quot; the planck length and be indistinguishable from a real life instrument? I assume it would also be impossible to make a stereo system that could play a waveform with distances smaller than the planck length

And the human ear would likely hit a limit long before that (even considering high-order harmonics)
Sample rate != Audible frequency.
first line
Anything past 48Khz is oversampled on most onboard soundcards
There&#039;s no reason to listen to anything more than 16-bit and 44100hz for entertainment. Hell, there&#039;s no real reason to use 24-bit for consumers because the dynamic range is already sufficient with 16-bit. Increasing the sample rate doesn&#039;t make anything sound better either. st–Shannon_sampling_theorem
I don&#039;t know about you, but I can still hear audio &quot;pixellation&quot; at 16-bit, it&#039;s 24-bit or go home
There is Nirvana and Lynyrd Skynyrd Thats pretty much it unless you are into classic music or some shit like amy whinehouse. Its dissapointing really..
That&#039;s literally not how bit depth works.
I pity those who cannot appreciate the beauty of classical music.
daily reminder
Of course dithering makes this nearly irrelevant for listeners
44.1 k I&#039;m unsure but it has to do with the Nyquist frequency being 22.05khz so that the recording will saturate the human hearing range . 48 k was introduced as all film was 24 fps so that the audio would properly sync
Just as we pity and scorn you for being locked into the past.

Discuss any method of making coffee, they all involve some kind of technology.
well, that&#039;s a fake picture.
as is the espresso from these kind of machines
I have the machine in pic related and in OP pic.Convenience has its merits. How do you make yours?
just with the good old rancilio silvia and a macap grinder
Pretty expensive for a machine that pushes hot water through coffee ground by another machine.
running through several of these philips machines in the same time is way more expensive
indeed.
Rocky and Silvia have got my back.
Cleaning/maintenance rituals?
I use a digital scale with my french press
I backflush every evening and flush it with cafiza once a week. grinder burr comes out to be cleaned maybe once every six months, but the macap stays incredibly clean because it has almost no dead space inside
Feels incredible man
this is mine


Your opinion on double-walled cups?I hate cold/lukewarm coffee, and while double-walled cups do a fantastic job at keeping coffee warm, I can&#039;t stand the feeling of cold glass against my lip and then scorching hot coffee against my tongue.
Just stop drinking coffee
most important thing about coffee is the grinder, second most is the machine, third most is the freshness of beans
best drip coffee machine for 100 dollars or less?
So basically it&#039;s better just make my own fucking coffee, but adding the all-important &quot;machine step&quot; that&#039;s makes this a $2500 experience?
I bought one of those double-boil coffee pots that works like a condenser for $20, is it /g/ approved
French press master race reporting in. It is the least /g/ device though.
Tryhard dumb faggot
the beans are the most important thing
I have shitty Jura C60 for everyday use and when I am feeling not lazy (happens every so and then) I&#039;ll use muh french Press
I won a Nespresso with 48 capsules some 4 months ago and it&#039;s pure disgusting trashI would be mad if I paid for it.
I use a keurig and it&#039;s good enough, but I don&#039;t mind doing 2 minutes of work to make a better coffeeI figure grinder and milk steamer won&#039;t take out too much cash
Don&#039;t fuck with me, I&#039;m an addict
I unfortunately got addicted to things that aren&#039;t stylish and hip
When the thing cost like 2 grand there&#039;s no excuse.
Japan is weird.
Yes. A pour-over coffee maker and a cheap blade grinder are perfectly fine. You have to sit there pouring for several minutes, but it&#039;s no big deal.  The fresh beans are going to be way better than a Keurig (and cheaper).
it&#039;s fucking amazing though
How is the Oster Prima Latte Pro?
The coffee is SO GOOD!  I find that Starbucks coffee works best with this machine.  Kcups are super convenient too.
Can I get either of these at Walmart and is there an easier way
Comfy&gt;Quality
I use a Siroca Crossline, it&#039;s an AIO grind n drip, but I only need some fast black coffee in the morning, I like it quite a lot, paid $120 USD for it.Will probably pick up some Starbucks from Costco to see what the fuss is about.
This is truly the most insignificant problem i&#039;ve ever heard.
Only easier way is to get a basic drip maker that boils/pours for you. No matter what, you have to do your own grind (a maker with built-in grinder is costly).
Exploding teeth is no joke, don&#039;t be so reckless
AEROPRESSI have found it the least acidic as I have the stomach of 100 year old woman

I used a gold filter cup for years.  Love that thing.  No paper filters needed, brews pretty quickly, just dump out the grounds and rinse the cup.A few years ago, my acid-sensitive brother-in-law mentioned that paper filters seemed to reduce the acid content.  So, I&#039;ve switched to that.  Basically, it&#039;s the same as the gold filter, but it takes a little longer and I have to buy a pack of filters every few months.
Life is good
Just add beans, water and flip the switch.
this is objectively the best drinking option. no acidity. no bitter flavor. costs way less. no need to add unhealthy sweeteners/creamers. why do we still drink coffee again??
that said this is /g/ so I don&#039;t assume you get out much
machine cant do that properly, its always the same which results in shit coffee
Fuck all this I&#039;ll just keep paying $3.75 for Dutch bros

They&#039;re obnoxious.  So much fake enthusiasm.  I just want a fucking coffee on my way somewhere more important, stop trying to be a meaningful part of my day and just make my goddamn coffee.
My alternative is the local slutcoffee stop and as enjoyable as that is I don&#039;t trust them
I&#039;m a really frugal poorfag who will complain about prices a lot too, but $2 for 200 paper coffee filters is about as cheap as things can possibly be. Why are you complaining about having to buy paper filters?
Gonna need more information on that one...
t. Poorfag
I look at it as an evolution of overly flirty baristas, they just pinpointed where their tips come from
I have a Jura J9 Impressa.  Happy with it.
you consumer whores will be the first ones in hell
I don&#039;t know the state of the laws, but I remember back when they instituted a distance requirement for strip joints that serve alcohol.  My friends all went to &quot;juice bars&quot; where you buy non-alcoholic drinks and the dancers grind on you.
&#039;fake&#039; as in &#039;the brewing is drawn in-- espresso and crema do not look like that&#039;.
I heard someone in class say they got a freshly-fingered finger to stir their drinks, that&#039;s the point where I realized I shouldn&#039;t be paying that much for a shitty coffee that could give me herpes when I can just buy a normal coffee and watch porn
I rather not
you haven&#039;t been  on /g/onsumerism long have you?
I have a saeco odea giro plus. I absolutely hate that there is zero check for water in the tank before brewing. There&#039;s not even a window on its side so you could see in there how much water is left. You just set the knob to a particular amount, brewing starts, and you may or may not get the chosen amount of water in your coffee.Any other automatic machines that do not have this flaw?
I eat generic caffeine pills instead. No work, prompt results, no cleanup, lower cost, total convenience.
Boil water over fire in a ceramic coated tin cup from walmart. Add two spoons of coffee grounds from local grocery store. Stir until grounds settle. Enjoy.
Cept coffee be good for you...
Finally, a coffee machine general. Does anyone know where i can find high-pressure PTFE tube fittings at a reasonable price? The one pictured is 28$ without shipping which is super retarded.
i can&#039;t get this on my head
I hope you also drink tap water and eat unflavored soylent bars exclusively, because all of the above reasons you already mentioned.
Why are people buying these high maintenance coffee machines when you could have a better cup of coffee with less effort + money with a french press?
It&#039;s all about convenience. Sure, you have to maintain the machine, but when you have, it&#039;s good for a week to dispense good coffee at the touch of a button.
I just use my electric kettle and put two table spoons of coffee in my french press, pour hot water on it and wait 4 minutes, then put the plunger down and serve. i don&#039;t even have to rinse it with soap if i rinse it right after is serve the coffee. plus you don&#039;t have to keep buying descaling solution.
But you have to repeat this process every time if you want coffee, while I can just press a button and have my coffee in 20-40 seconds, and pick the time when I do the maintenance work. It&#039;s all about time management.
I use a bonavita Gooseneck kettle and a Lauria pour over coffee dripper.
easy there bateman
Nice,  that made me laugh.
bit of letdown. moka pot is better anyway

The inversion method is supposed to be used to let the coffee brew for a few minutes to simulate a French press. Try 3-4 mins next time.
Ok listen here /g/pic unrelated
I want someone to talk to...

same here...

TeamSpeakYou have only tried P2P hosted solutions, which will inevitably drop a call and uses a ton of bandwidth.  All of what I listed are server-based and will only drop out if the person talking has a garbage connection, but it will only drop them out

Hi dude. What&#039;s up?
He is a scam artist. Useless videos. Make X in 5 minutes. Let me just write some code at 10x speed and not even show the end result. Fuck this faggot

Was watching a vid last night. Pretty interesting stuff. Didn&#039;t understand anything but he moved around a lot. Really kept my attention.

POO

has anyone tried out the VS 2017 RC yet!?
Sounds like you&#039;re made for each other.
He makes good vids for people who know absolutely nothing about what he&#039;s talking about to learn about what tools are out there etc. Pretty sure that&#039;s all he&#039;s trying to do.
Elon Musk seems to think his videos are worth sharing.
He has decent content but I don&#039;t understand one thing:Why does he go so fast if his videos are aimed at novice people? Even on his streams he is always in a hurry and won&#039;t even explain the code he types.

Ha ha ha
There&#039;s rumors that it&#039;s time for the yearly Christmas DDoS. :(
The tracker&#039;s economy. Imo, it&#039;s not stable enough to start auto-snatching and I don&#039;t have the buffer for it yet, either.
Yep by all the weebs At anime bytes
Anime was a mistake.
/ptg/ was a mistake

Why do private trackers hate 4chan users so much?
someone actually snatched my torrent, holy fuck, after uploading 100+, finally
Noticed something funny, PTH users care more about freedom and probably have more money.
No one hates them, you are just too subhuman and need to think anyone evenr emotely think about you even in form of some anonymous guy in some anonymous site
is this the true PTH experience?
bullshit, I just uploaded 5 and one was autosnatched immediately


apl stats haven&#039;t updated for a week or so
so it&#039;s probably even worse
Because it was banned on WCD.

Im in the same boat. It takes so fucking long to get your average seeding size up if you didn&#039;t seed for a long time..
can&#039;t wait for that garbage tracker to die
Youre welcome;)

so, what if Apollo is just gonna put in a 32p-esque token system? No downloads, only upload.Keeps the auto-snatch bots uploading and lets users actually download without fucking their ratio
Don&#039;t drag me into this, I&#039;ve never posted anything about hook shit. Just some random idiots trying to continue the stupid tracker war.

I&#039;m about to fill that avril lavigne req btw
Seems like this year it&#039;s non-cabal trackers getting attacked, last year it was exclusively cabal ones.
That&#039;s not accurate anymore.
Is there any reason to force encryption on deluge? I&#039;m assuming I will connect to less peers doing so.
gg
wow PTH staff must have shit donations huh
Am I missing something? Those graphs are basically the same.
could be worse

I&#039;m amazed IPT hasn&#039;t been taken down yet. It must make a fortune from piracy.
Especially since cabal members doxed the owner last year.

Pedro&#039;s
wasn&#039;t there a post on reddit once that exposed the ipt owner scamming users with the lottery?
Fukken lel&#039;d
ipt&#039;s donations in general are a huge scam, it&#039;s absurdly easy to get upload credit/bonus points
Jesus fucking christ, is IPT genuinely run by some mafia in New Jersey or something? How can one tracker feel this sleazy?
it was actually a sequence of images of a smiley with a carat nose
try Russia.
ipt is pretty based 2bh
That&#039;s why they ban people so they donate to get their account back. :^)
The owner is an Afgani living in Russia. He&#039;s safe from Western Anti-Piracy orgs

anon it&#039;s Russia tier shitty here I wouldn&#039;t be surprised
t. IPT staff
muslim mafia. the owner is muslim

the community is horrific, the donation jewing is gross (the fucking banner takes you to the donation page instead of the home page), and mods will literally take down someone&#039;s uploads to upload it themselves

guess the tracker
If you still have the .CUE file, you should able to reproduce a perfect copy.
Does this work on PTH?https://youtu.be/s9xKp43dveA
I have no idea how to answer this.

Probably a function of AB finally reaching their post upgrade user limit.
Challenge #2 = More open registration!
are we playing guess the tracker?
I wonder what tracker this is
is he that retarded to not notice that other torrents dont have log files?
A log file is worthless as they can be faked in seconds
It&#039;s an honest question.
filename
you&#039;re worthless.
It can happen to anyone.
Its not his fault guys.
same reason why .ape can get fucked
mp3 it&#039;s like the same thing right?
All meming aside. I think Apollo is going to overtake PTH as the primary music tracker unless the staff at PTH do something. They had a 100k torrent lead and its like 40k now, there are less users, less activity, less interaction with staff, and overall feels like a boring stale place. I personally don&#039;t care who wins. But in a month&#039;s time I expect APL to have overtaken PTH. The PTH uploaders will switch to APL where their uploads actually get some love, then game over.
yeah nj is pretty shit all around except maybe princeton
no growth isn&#039;t good
t. xanax staff


you have go to be retarded if you think elitism kills trackers

Pick up the 6 piece set at Bed Bath and Beyond and take an extra 15% off.

samefag harder shill
Before XNX had their freeleech, upload rates were awful and people were complaining about nobody snatching. The real test for XNX will be when their freeleech eventually ends (if ever).
Are there any good trackers in the AB PU Invite forum?
DELET THIS
this picture gave me a hardone
go ask ThePepe
A the end of the day who cares about the torrent count when there a million bandcamp releases and half a million ebooks. It&#039;s about snatches, having content that people want. If they don&#039;t have it then they request it. 99% of the content that the torrent community wants will be on both trackers. However, it will actually be shared and enjoyed more on APL.

ctrl+f the last thread
You are a sinner
Speaking of the oscars, where&#039;s the best place to get screeners and cams now PTP banned them? Should I apply for a TehC account?
just how bad is it?
lmao btn is what i thought, too, when i saw that picture
fucking kill me Anon

There&#039;s a special thread in the TK forum for screeners @ PTP
I&#039;d rather have a TC account than a bloAtHD account.
Screeners are cancer anyways, not sure why you want them.
Anything can happen is the lesson of 2016, but it is remarkable that no amount of desperate free handouts has pushed Apollo past PTH&#039;s numbers yet.
good meme :^)
But it&#039;s funny. I placed my bet on pth, uploaded there. And now im not sure. Guess i need to start uploading to apl.
ok
fuggggg :-----^---D
And I&#039;d assume that&#039;s because of the huge lack of quality control on APL.
any /RIPPING/ alerts lately?http://vocaroo.com/i/s14xpIB9Pq8R
Oh shit. That&#039;s fast. A day ago apl was ahead. By like a thousand or so.
Stats as of Fri Dec 16 00:02:05 2016 UTC:
It&#039;s actually because APL staff is cracking down hard on transcodes/rules broken etc. and have deleted a shit ton of stuff in the past day.
http://vocaroo.com/i/s0Bj0Sfr93nJ
:^^^)
sounds like something from silent hill
204 S/L ratio
In the last 48 hours there have been 10 transcodes deleted. &quot;cracking down&quot; my ass.
Idk i just find this lingoism confusing
All PTH needs to do is reopen all the standard recruitments - ggn, ahd, mam, bib, btn... Then everyone will want to join it and contribute in order to survive and level up. It&#039;s the missing link.
Aren&#039;t they doing pu on ptp now? That&#039;s like half the torrent community.
stay salty Anon :^)
I now realized i didnt phrase myself right. I meant relevant trackers start recruiting at PTH.
Go take a look at the PTH topic in GGn. It got remade.
So whose dick do I have to suck to get an invite to Apooloo or PTH?
http://vocaroo.com/i/s1uURYc684gV
definitely forces you to consider

Oh you mean invite threads on pth? Not the other way around. Seems kinda silly at this point. Chances are if you are in pth you are in all other relevant trackers you want to be in.
You&#039;re a great fit for apooloo
Yes, right now that&#039;s the situation. But if they recreate what WCD was, which is the starting point into PT world, that will change.
libble
I can losslessly transcode ASCII text to UTF-16 for instance.
No shit, but in context when someone is talking about transcodes being deleted it&#039;s obvious it&#039;s about transcodes from lossy sources.
the term &quot;transcode&quot; is 9/10 times used negatively to refer to a lossy -&gt; lossless transcode. anyone who&#039;s spent more than 5 minutes on a private music tracker knows this
Makes sense senpai.
if he passed the What interview, he&#039;d know what it meant.
there is no real right or wrong. like the other anon said, its about context
The Blu-Ray is already ENCODED as H.264 or VC-1. Further encoding yields a lossy transcode.

cannot believe

no, but i remember when you posted it like a day ago. what is your share rank?
I&#039;m VIP :)

No shit, how is that relevant to the current music discussion? We&#039;re not APL users here, this is basic stuff.

If you have elite proof you can get a PTH invite.
Or a furry sucking dick
PTP was recruiting on bB until what.cd went down.
And I don&#039;t, all I have for proof I was even ever on WCD are old .torrent files and anecdotal knowledge. I also got all my other tracker invites through the WCD Invites forum.
PTH accepts elite with some kind of proof. Check you browser cache.
Do you have the WCD elite forum in your browser history?
Both clear on browser close.
Not much higher than VIP, Anon
They may accept that. Seriously though learn how to activate offline mode in your browser because your cache could have your profile.

tfw proper opsec means you cant get into private trackers
RIP a paranoid faggot.
nope
is AB an okay tracker to use to get to other trackers?
Oh well, who would I even contact if I had proper proofs?

I&#039;ve got a python string that i want to print out at the center of the terminal window. How do i count the letters of the string without counting the function names?
When you say -&quot;2&quot; JavaScript converts the string to a negative number so it&#039;s the  same as saying &quot;5&quot; + -2 and since you can&#039;t  concatenate a string to a number, it converts the -2 into a string.

When you look at the state of the Javascript ecosystem, it&#039;s no surprise you guys are so incompetent.
Apply yourself.
That&#039;s because I&#039;m not an insecure little bitch, kiddo.
projecting much?
I&#039;m not sure you know what that word means, kid.

Does your mom know you use all these bad words?
Maybe if you applied yourself hard enough you could figure out how to fix it, but that&#039;s probably too much thinking for a vegetable.

Tell me more, you&#039;re entertaining ^__^
Writing an image thumbnailer in C for a shitty imageboard. Implementing lossy PNG compression right now.
Actually I would like to hear more about projects that you have worked on, as a /real/ programmer.
So in response to &#039;JavaScript knowers, can you explain what is happening?&#039;, you would say... strong typing?
It&#039;s what
Jesus Christ.
You don&#039;t think iterating through the members of a struct at run time is neat?
If so where do I sign up?
You said something about fizzbuzz, that&#039;s some sweet irony considering web developers need a library package for &quot;left pad&quot;.

You can&#039;t simulate what was actually being done in C#; C# will not coerce a string to an integer.
Oh my god...This language must be created as a prank.
Every single example posted in this thread has been bad and you should feel bad.
Even C does that.
No, it&#039;s useless.
Why are so many languages trying to push things like &#039;option types&#039; (example from Swift) to handle possibly null pointers/values, when they could just give the language ADTs?
don&#039;t you like diversity?
Last I checked, there were library functions that did this in other /real/ programming languages. I don&#039;t get what you have against a small package that basically does the same thing.
I have no strong feelings either way. I&#039;m egalitarian like that.
Then they would have to make a reasonable effort to make recursion practical.  Look at Rust - it has ADTs proper, but they&#039;re still a pain to use if you have to worry about stack overflow.
GNU Emacs is love.
gross
It works.
Your setup is shit.

So yeah, I&#039;m making fun of you.
That doesn&#039;t work anon.
Now that&#039;s projection.
You learned them and they never annoy you.
That doesn&#039;t make any sense.
eyelets get out
No it just proved that you&#039;re an assisted. I know how to handle large code with a 80x24 terminal. And if you need more it&#039;s because you lack coding skill.
You&#039;re a gun grabber, aren&#039;t you?
What does it mean?
Not to get political, but a common argument from gun right&#039;s opponents is along the lines of, &quot;Well, no one &#039;needs&#039; a 30-round magazine!&quot;, whereas &#039;need&#039; has literally nothing to do with the conversation.
You have the chance to speak to a true coder, learn from me or stay ignorant.
Except you&#039;re not, because I&#039;m not even a web developer.

You build a tree of possible consequences and you make computer to compare which is better for him.
It can&#039;t be that difficult can it? I just need to somehow figure out how to hook into browser in order to retrieve the board position and then send it to chess engine and then move the piece based on its result

Fucking kek
I wouldn&#039;t be creating a chess engine, there&#039;s already much better ones. I just want to know how I can make a bot that will play chess in a browser

Anyway, learn chess notation, make browser to visualise this notation.

I want to learn a graphical language but I&#039;ve only worked with python before where should i start.
I think you&#039;re better off making something in a scripting language that just reads pixel colors instead
Oh yeah it&#039;s in javascript then i just mean it seems kind of difficult to read from browser with an external program like that
does anyone have the programming projects chart?
but it&#039;s easier in many ways because it doesn&#039;t require you to learn javascript, how http headers work, data analysis, etc

How about if they have a mobile app, would it be easier to somehow modify that to play a chessbot if it&#039;s opensource?
what do you mean?
I only program in JS desu.

and that would probably be java or c++ for a mobile game

Hi! I was trying to implement a function that doesis this possible in lambda calculus? I&#039;m not haskeller, but I think I can understand if you have a code snippet that does this
No, that&#039;s not possible.  It doesn&#039;t make sense as an operation.
It&#039;s basically one guy working on it. All we can do now is hope it will be on by default eventually. I just want something better than balancing between the shit that is JPEG and lossy PNG.

I don&#039;t know if they did something special, because it&#039;s Linux, or they just give up after a certain number of contributors/commits.
Neither said anything about a slippery slope, what are you even on about
It should be obvious that the integer simply hit the maximum of whatever type they use to store the count.
Fast contraband detection system for the police.
Why?
why not?
Because there is this data type called integer.
Waste of space for image dimensions.
I&#039;m strugging to get my hands on the Visual C++ compiler.Obviously i have to add it to the PATH variable but a search for &quot;cl.exe&quot; doesn&#039;t bring up anything on my computer. They explicitly claimed it would install the Visual C++ compiler, but it&#039;s nowhere to be found?
Install MSYS2 or use a sane OS.
short then
I&#039;d imagine that info structure is also used for stuff where it might be useful to have dimensions in percent, i.e resizing existing images

neatAlthough I really don&#039;t want to make another game.
not really a waste, because as soon as you go above 9999x9999 pixels, you lose when compared to integer
Then why not use a struct with an integer and a float field?
Triggered
Sounds like poor design to use the same struct for both, and they should use a tagged union even if so.
Again I&#039;ve never worked with that, just what I pieced together from a quick google search
This tbqh. Read a book you fucking memester.
I feel like programming in F# today with .NET Core. Someone give me a programming challenge.You mean 65535x65535 pixels?
bootloader
That&#039;s such a terrible way to implement it.  What is wrong with C programmers?  And why should that be the library&#039;s responsibility in the first place?  Just check if it&#039;s smaller or whatever before resizing, ffs.
Can&#039;t do that in F#.
now compare that to INT32_MAX
Why isn&#039;t your language of choice Turing complete?
C++ Compiler
not necessarily the c programmers fault, jmagic and Rmagick have the same imageInfo structure and use strings (or geometries) as well, maybe it was just the simplest way to have very similar implementations in different languages
also apparently you can also use postscript page size nicknames (like A0 or Letter) as sizes
I&#039;m talking about type widths. Integer is YUGE for image dimensions. You won&#039;t need anything bigger than short, most likely (as larger images tend to cause crashing with most software).
Make an assembler in F# then make bootloader in assembly. Also checked.
It is turing complete. I don&#039;t think there are compilers for F# for freestanding environments, however. it needs the CLR.
Its useless, but its cool!
Why are the tripfags in this thread such massive wincucks?

You said &#039;dimensions&#039;, but never specified that we were talking about images.
I know you have autism, but come on.
No.
Dimensions are always absolute you tit.  -5 on an XY plane still has a length of 5 from the origin.
Is the transition between Java and C# difficult? Or could I jump into difficult projects and just google the syntax as I go?
that.
Look up LINQ when you get cozy.  It&#039;s bomb.
There are (shockingly) a few things that Java did right and C# lacks, though.
Not in a hostile way, I&#039;m genuinely curious.
readonly/const are fucking garbage and final is better. Can&#039;t think of any others at this exact moment, but I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll come to me.
Because honestly I prefer Readonly/Const options vs a single Final option.  Makes it more clear what the intent is.
Pretty shitty, desu.
That doesn&#039;t seem bad in practice though.  You shouldn&#039;t be using constant/finals in local scopes and constants only work on compile-time because it&#039;s constant, it SHOULD be a compiled value rather than JIT/runtime

Php may be utter trash, but its real easy to throw a site together.
What else would they use?
lua, html, xhtml, et
You mean they don&#039;t use HTML now?

doesnt php generate the html?

openwrt does it quite effectively. see LuCi
I don&#039;t know. I definitely would use something typesafe, like Scala, Java or GoProbably Go.


Can LuCi serve a million concurrent connections?
Ye
This is one of the reasons PHP got such a bum rap (that and SQL injection, which they fixed with bind_param in version 5 many years ago). PHP is easy, so a lot of new programmers give it a go without any previous knowledge of typecasting (or programming). Typecasting is a waste of time and effort if you know what your doing, and that&#039;s what makes PHP fast, they cut out a lot of the busy work. It&#039;s a language for making web pages, not scientific analysis of the human genome. It&#039;s a great language with endless tutorials available online, it&#039;s just has to many wanna be programmers giving it a bad name.
How do you find/keep track of onion sites?
Current PHP isn&#039;t actually that bad. Just like JS is pretty good. They both get bad rep because a lot of people who are just starting out use them without any idea of what to do. The biggest problem with PHP I have is that working with it usually means working with legacy codebase that makes you want to blow your brains out every day at lunch break.
kek.
okay that got me

Working with terrible code for so long has taught me patience, and being good at reading bad code is a useful skill too.

This has improved a lot, and is looking really neat. Don&#039;t really like the yellow stripe on the mouse pad, but it&#039;s not a big deal. Maybe get a lamp to put behind one of the monitors and it can look even better.
Really nice desk surface.

How do you stand actually using the G13? Do you use it? I have one myself and I find it intolerable compared to my keyboard, the keys just feel so mushy when I try to use it for anything.
Getting shit done under the ovaries.
Do I literally put the lamp right behind both of my monitors?
Obviously the best set up here.
Also where could I get that lamp?
I only use it in games though where there is an extreme number of keys to be bound, so I can use just the stick to move, and all my buttons for something else. I&#039;m mainly using it for macros in productivity software nowadays or as multimedia or shortcut keys.
I found it on a local store, but searching for &quot;minimal cloth lamp&quot; can get you lots of similar ones.

Afternoon gents

Good afternoon friend. I really like your setup, I wish I had a bed that large!
hey! join the discord btw! https://discord.gg/PS3Urhq
The lamp looks pretty nice and close to what I have. Just make sure to check its dimensions and see if you can fit it there. The bulbs also look pretty similar to the color of the ones I have, which is the coziest.
Depends. If you have a 44 key controller, you can pretty much set any color, including warm white. The main point of a lamp would be added aesthetics, if that&#039;s not a given, LED lights waste less space while remaining unseen.
Yeah, that&#039;s what I meant. If it&#039;s just for lighting, LED strips can work just as well, and you don&#039;t have to set it to really strong colors like most people do, but I personally think lamps do add some more interesting aesthetics as you said, though they also waste a bit of space.
Nice setup. I have the same shitty webcam lol. Might I ask, why did you go for the full tower case with a small form factor mobo?
Lmao, fucking larper.
Keycool 84, it&#039;s okay but not great.
What bulb are you using?
Thanks. It is a full ATX, the arc xl is just a stupid big case.
how much does that one cost?
I don&#039;t really remember the exact specs of the bulb, just that it was a low power yellow LED one, but judging by the wattage and temperature on the one you linked, it looks similar. Once it&#039;s inside the lamp it diffuses more light and looks a bit softer. But yeah, if you can fit it behind there and don&#039;t want to go for LED strips, which saves space and gives you more color options, but might not look as cozy and aesthetically pleasing, go for it.
Just worked on rearranging furniture yesterday and at the moment i&#039;m just starting out with my battlestation so a lot of it is going to be replaced in the next few months.
Hmmm...
I am always working to make my setup better.

I fell for the memechanical too. Never again. If there was such a thing as a tenkeyless membrane keyboard with traditional keycaps, I&#039;d go for it.
There&#039;s not really anything that comes to mind apart from the lighting. It&#039;s looking pretty nice already. Looking forward to seeing the new stuff!
I had a Snake but sold her so now I have all of this empty space.
uh here&#039;s mine
I appreciate that you&#039;re not an autistic neat freak, but how do you access all of that shit when you have 4 monitors in the way?

That&#039;s probably up to you. You could make it a study area, with a desk lamp and some books, or display some figures, games, music, movies or whatever. It&#039;s up to you and whatever you&#039;re into or what can use it for.
why not a 750 or ti? did you get the 740 for super cheap?
It replaced an 8800GT that died on me. I took a long hard look at the games I played which is mostly all classics from the 1999/2004 era and decided that a 740GT would handle them all without sweat. Plus yeah I got it during a great deal on newegg

It isn&#039;t. I found a set of keyboards at a thrift shop by my house that were used for some sort of video editing program. They had shortcuts labeled on the keys. I thought they looked cool so I just scraped of the printing with a knife and popped the keys on the way I preferred, it was pretty fun. I&#039;d rather just have a mechanical keyboard though.
Thanks, hope it&#039;s even better now, that I explained some things.
yeah that makes more sense. I think it&#039;s bretty good
Mine, r8
Separate question but kind of related, do you guys actually use these giant speakers you have?  Might just be me but I kind of grew out of blasting music loud.  Headphones manage to do the trick and aren&#039;t these useless pieces of shit around your desk/room for 99.9% of their lifespan.
8/10
I FUCKING DID IT. NOT NICE CABLE MANAGEMENT BUT ITS MINE. I DID IT /BST/. NOW I JUST NEED TO BURN A WINDLWS 7 ISO
10/10 picture
I prefer listening on my speakers since I feel like it&#039;s a more refine experience
10/10 much space
looks comfy
good for you! do you have a skylake CPU? then no you won&#039;t be installing windows 7 lmao
r8
activate windows/10
you people are autists
I had the same exact set and I changed them recently.
any particular reason? I like this keyboard/mouse
I thought the same thing man, but once I got better shit I realized how shitty they were.
Can you explain why you would ever want to have the computer on the desk? I swear i´t&#039;s the most autistic shit.
potato quality brought to you by samshit™
bullshit, that&#039;s like buying a fucking expensive car with chrome rims and shit, and then not being able to afford to fill it up with gas
turn the fucking lights on before taking a picture
Do you spin the speakers whenever you want to listen to them at your desk? Is that why they&#039;re on wheels? They might not be, can&#039;t quite tell.
Good dildo and rocks you&#039;ve got there, maybe cover the table with more of those.

So yeah, basically a manchild. I&#039;ve played and still like a ton of old Nintendo games, but that doesn&#039;t mean I keep masturbating over the NES, because I&#039;m not autistic.

$69 to replace one of an easily losable pair. The pair costs $150 so this is basically full retail

The replacement doesnt come with the charge box.

Does not compute.
it&#039;s your video drivers. happened to me a bunch too when i had gimped drivers. if you&#039;re on linux consider removing your current drivers and completely reinstalling new ones properly
must be that those opensoruce drivers suck balls
and it&#039;s different for every single machine, card, etc so it&#039;s hard to give advice on what to do. in gentoo it&#039;s really easy to install graphics drivers for some reason (you&#039;d figure it&#039;d be harder)
Chrome doesn&#039;t draw web pages via the GPU and the effect is constrained the the area of the browser.  It&#039;s a software issue.
I&#039;m on closed source Nvidia drivers ona  GTX 970, it occurs on integrated intel on my 15.04 laptop, too.  It&#039;s not about the drivers.
no, it&#039;s not an issue with Chrome at all. the Xorg server takes a snapshot of your screen at random intervals and it shows up whenever you go to full screen. that exact same problem happened to me (i was using an integrated amd CPU)
will test it with wayland and see if still happens

Oh, and browsers just handing over everything to that godawful Youtube app.  Christ, I&#039;d pay $5 just to prevent that alone.
Just install AdBlock (or whatever) on Firefox. It supports add-ons, you know. Also fixes your YouTube problem.
This happened to me when I was using XFCE with nouveau on Linux.
This is technically not an application bug, it&#039;s the graphics driver&#039;s job to give an application empty VRAM.. but then again if Google really cared about Incognito being volatile and not leaving traces, they should probably at least give the option to scramble video memory before releasing it.
/g/ will never admit that their precious linux might have problems
I thought FF was still ridiculously slow on Android though...
incognito mode is better because delete the temporal files
lol i know what you mean. I&#039;ve been get the same thing on youtube just recently. I thought it was a YouTube specific bug.
Because this happens to me but with every program, it keeps old images that flash randomly when redraws happen. It doesn&#039;t happen with the xrender backend but xrender has awful tearing. Maybe it&#039;s the fault of FGLRX, I don&#039;t know.
damn I hate those opensoruce drivers
Your video driver is reading uninitialized data, which happens to be the memory region used to draw your porn.
I want to start running my own VPN and need noob-level advice for that.With that, I could go with my laptop to a place I know every morning to work without temptations (like playing videogames or watching porn) The wifi of that place is a honeypot for crackers, many users, most of them unaware of how to protect themselves, and on top of all, said wifi has WEP encryption (although you just need to ask for its password and they give it to you freely) (Yeah, it&#039;s a place the local council runs and I guess they couldn&#039;t care less about their users&#039; security)
Enjoy prison.
Firstly, it wouldn&#039;t be the FBI. Aside of that, tell me about the obvious exploit I&#039;m not seeing
Just get a router that has built-in OpenVPN capabilities.


tor + onioncat + iptablesnow gfto
Why?
Because the chances anybody is using that public wifi to steal valuable information or doing MITM attacks is worrying.
Also, to learn something interesting
And even if I weren´t using that public wifi but another, I would like to improve the security of my internet connection from public places
VPN is used to hide your activities from your own ISP and to fake your real life location. You usually buy VPN in a country with more freedom than your current country (so for USA you can try Russia and vice versa for maximum effect :-) and pay small fee for it.
I will behave like a normie using my own VPN, I just want to protect myself against everybody but the government. For the later, perhaps I would use TOR (even though I think it&#039;s not secure anymore)
I have my own OpenVPN server running on my raspi.  It works great when I&#039;m at work and want to work on my homelab, or i&#039;m travelling connecting to unsecured hotspots it&#039;s nice knowing I have more security.Just follow the hundreds of tutorials on how to set it up.  Or just flash your router with DD-WRT mega or tomato with vpn.
About the raspberry, I&#039;ll have to check it. The closest thing I imagined to have a small PC running at all times would be a small PC made with discarded components I could buy in any PC workshop. I still would need to learn how to install a basic distro of Linux that allow me to run just the OpenVPN server and just basic utilities I would need, nothing else. It will save money on the electricity bill.
I think a VPN would be overkill unless you want to access network resources on your home LAN remotely.
I can pull 2 mb/s at work off my home lan which is just limited to home upload speed.
important!
Faking your real life location is more important, imo.  So many sites are profiling people by IP now, it&#039;s scary.
But a lot of those companies are shouting privacy and no log policy but there is no way for you to verify that.
added bonus, it&#039;s up and maintained 100% of the time so you don&#039;t need to keep your home computer running
Oh, I thought it was for privacy or something interesting like stopping GCHQ form spying on you.
Come at me bro, you understand me
Do they allow you to install stuff on their servers?
there are usually only a couple of restrictions, often you can&#039;t send out mass mail and you can never utilize 100% cpu 24hrs a day (unless you pay more)
Hi /g/, I have a graphics card question. I have a Asus GTX 760 in my computer and my I got a free EVGA GT 740 from my work because they were throwing it out. Since they are both nvidia cards and 2GB can I crossfire them? Pic related is what I got today
no.

there&#039;s probably someone right now who&#039;s secretly making an archive of all of Snapchat through a hidden backport and are gonna leak it all in like 15 years to screw up someo political campaign or create a celebrity scandal for money or something like that.
So like actual passwords or password hashes?
Funny, for the past year I&#039;ve been getting notifications sent to a Yahoo email account I no longer use saying that someone from China has been trying to access another Yahoo email account that I lost years ago to Chinese gold farmers.
Phew good thing I don&#039;t post any stupid shit
Everything gets hacked. I don&#039;t even care anymore.
And if you&#039;re targeting an individual with a special snowflake password, you can still probably crack it. I doubt Yahoo historically used anything better than MD5.
How are they so fucking incompetent? They should get fined heavily for this.
We lose anyway.

md5 holy fuck lol. How can a company be so fucking useless?
Well when the user base of your website has no idea how babby is formed, your employees are bound to not want to stick around.

Absolutely no one outside of Japan even uses Yahoo anymore.

EXTREEEEMEE
From Yahoo! to Literally Who?
that was quite good. 8/10
Males couldn&#039;t do magic either.
Will this finally kill Yahoo? Will anything?
Fucking Yahoo...
Holy shit you can blow through thousands of these a minute with a single Kepler card and Hashcat.
MD5 = Shit

So crazy that&#039;s a lot of fucking accounts.
Will their shares fall 4% now?
why is yahoo still a thing and how the fuck do they have 1 billion accounts?
No you idiot. It&#039;s exponential. If you double the accounts then you square the share drop percentage.
the yahoo is for penetrate :D
Accounts built up over the many years of their life span, some forgotten and left there to collect dust and limit naming options.
Yeah, I lost all my stupid shit in a tragic boating accident.

Holy shit my gaiaonline password is the same as my yahoo email address! How screwed am I?
Certainly not ours?
so what&#039;s the proper way to permanently wipe clean my yahoomail account?
anyone have the dump yet?
Obviously we need more female CEOs in tech.
Good thing I only used yahoo email for fake shit, registering burner usernames,  shitposting and spam.
Why not use 10minutemail?

check your flickr bookmarks mah niggasshit is about to disappear if this keeps on going



it&#039;s md5 and no salt.

Would Marissa let me fuck her if I can fix Yahoo!?
JUST

It was in 2013, they apparently updated to bcrypt not long after.
I&#039;d be much more worried about my post-newfag posts being leaked. I used to be a normie with normal tastes, now I&#039;m a bigot and a weirdo.
Fucking hell, I used to feel bad for yahoo but they are just so careless with data. I am pretty sure this is why my yahoo email was compromised, my old facebook linked to it was also compromised and used to spam and they even made a twitter account for spamming. I am glad I switched to gmail because I had 10000 unread emails in yahoo years ago
who even has a yahoo account though? I know its relatively big in Japan but I thought it didn&#039;t really have market share anywhere.
ok so wheres the txt file of the passes
holdover accounts from the last decade? is yahoo japan even affected?
You not knowing it doesn&#039;t make it go away.
Google leak when?
as well as your name, browsing habits, personal details, etc.
that was a pretty stupid comment tbd
:^)
I think he meant a thusand cracked passwords per minute
MD5 was suspected to be broken in 1993 and known to be broken in 1996.
...hell, they probably do.
this. magnet link fucking where?
This is what happens when women is in charge
How does this not prove to people how dangerous it is to store all that fucking data?

Ok?
DON&#039;T FORGET THE &quot;TEN GORILLION&quot; HACKED ACCOUNTS!!!
i don&#039;t think it actually tries to verify, it just sends you an email or text when someone changes the shit...
Yahoo losing billions of user data, losing billion of $ every year. Yahoo= losing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM6dio31vcA
Who uses their yahoo mail for important shit anyway?!
Oh like google?
google actually requires the verification either in the form of the email or through the mobile authenticator
i have 2 step auth on yahoo, and i have to get a text message with a code before it lets me sign on
Her main fault is not disclosing the hack back when they knew it in 2013. Her and everyone else that fucking knew.
what are the details on the md5 blunder?is it salted or just plain md5?
plain
i used a long ass password in my yahoomail and i now have to check if it&#039;s hash is in the web. jesus christ.
that&#039;s pretty neat. I didn&#039;t think of doing this before.
I stopped using my yahoo mail account like 15 years ago. I couldn&#039;t give a fuck if it was broken into
this
I always use Gmail and Protonmail now.
They&#039;re yahoo alright..

God I miss this..
Jesus Christ, the world has gone mad.
Who still uses Yahoo email?
how would they know my name if I&#039;ve never given it to them?
So is there a superior email service that doesn&#039;t demand you link up with a mobile phone, has decent security, doesn&#039;t try to push other products on you and isn&#039;t Google?
My mum.
American or British?
Yandex doesn&#039;t require phone number. I don&#039;t trust it, but I don&#039;t trust any of the American services either.
You&#039;ve typed it in somewhere while Google was watching.
Why all those big IT companies always are hacked? Why the hackers need that database?
You do know this site is 18+ right?
How fucked am I?
Only large AI systems or governments could do it and their footprint would be so large it would be obvious.  Corporations wouldn&#039;t bother because of the ramifications and associated costs.
get to changing security shit son
Someone you know or yourself have typed in your name at some point while google is watching
It doesn&#039;t even matter if they use md5 or not, they can reset your password with security questions
the people that still have actual active accounts deserved it if you ask me

What would you do in this situation?

I have the CM half x, can someone explain to me what this cut out is for?  it looks too small, if I replace my CPU, I have to take the whole board out?  if the whole was bigger I would not have to take the whole board out?  why did they make it so small?
Some coolers need an extra bracket in the back so as ot not sheer the board when putting on heavy heat syncs
You gotta take the cpu from the other side so..
motherboards come in different sizes and with different cpu locations
I don&#039;t get it why is the bracket there?
Its a fucking hole so you can put your god damn bracket on the back of your cpu so you dont fucking rip your mobo in 1/3rds
Are you fucking retarded? The hole is there so you can mount an after market cooler without needing to remove the whole motherboard.
yes
i am
how would a cooler even fit back there?  I have a water cooler in the front
THE BRACKET YOU DEGENERATIVE FUCK
The hole is suppose to line up with your cooler mounting bracket. Either that case is shit or your mobo is shit.
Jesus can you tell us how old your are?
a water cooler would not fit in the back

Who gave you a computer
you&#039;re gonna have to take your mobo out
i don&#039;t why they don&#039;t just make it a bit bigger for every case

those are not freedom
Reminder /g/ that stallman himself has said that art does not need to be libre, just the software. So you can still run Doom or Quake with GPL&#039;d engine and proprietary artwork without any problems.
yD2Ayokw
steam because it runs on ubuntoe

that doesn&#039;t make it libre
OpenRW (Openrenderware)GTA3 open sauce engine, vice city and SA are planned
dota 2 is free
Any Source game.
valve is the most anti-freedom bloat loving botnet there is
Zandronum officially replaced Skulltag a while back, it&#039;s a pretty solid source port. /vr/ has a decent starting config for it.
As much as i&#039;d like to recommend something, vidya belongs in /v/
That&#039;s why people can do whatever they want with their games?
but freedom belongs here. and this is not just about any video game
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_lable_source_code
/v/ hates freedom and this is less about games and more about free software.
Can I recompile them to play in my not x86 computer?

If you want, to go right on ahead.
yeah, looks decent
Yeah that&#039;s fucking abysmal.
you can even put some ship it with your won artwork and sell it for $$$

None of those are free

linux is a meme, stick to windows
Nah, it&#039;s shit. I&#039;ve been using GNU/Linux for a little over 15 years and to be honest the disadvantages outweigh the advantages by far. If you&#039;re a NEET or something and have lots of time and want to learn about it then go for it, but otherwise don&#039;t. Free GNU/Linux is only worth something if your time is worthless.
You lincucks are pathetic, you watch chinese pedo cartoons but make fun off people who play games
I have no idea where you get those assertions. Cartoons are for kids, gaming is for kids. Get triggered, manlet.
No defragging, no virus scanning bullshit software/programs 24/7, no annoying &#039;Hey! download this forced update&#039;.
if you play AAA games not.if u don&#039;t need a only windows software, swicth
well you can use trap
Do VGA Passthrough. Based on my experience with FOSS AMD drivers, passing through radeonsi and below (GCN 1 and below) can also be bound and unbound to the X session so you don&#039;t need to reboot to revert GPU changes, only restart the X server (I still restart if I need full performance to reset my scheduler and preemption timer). You need a fresh reboot for AMDGPU but I&#039;ve been working on a method to use a kexec jump instead.
There are none.
keep a windows desktop for playing games if that&#039;s your thing.  I have a windows desktop for recording music, computers and software are tools don&#039;t be stupid about it and use the wrong tool for the jobi use linux on my laptop because it&#039;s a better shitposting OS
I had Mint 17.3 on my laptop and I never had any problems, but now with Mint 18 on my desktop, it keeps fucking up.

Why are they for kids? Can you explain?
no spyingbut don&#039;t install meme distros
Because they were invented for kids to consume
So?
i&#039;m impressed
you can make linux your daily driver and use QEMU with vfio for windows if you gaymen
I would recommend Mint if he wants to game, it was painless to install nvidia drivers along with Steam and PlayOnLinux/Wine. Debian and Ubuntu are huge pains in comparison.
Don&#039;t bother with arch, it&#039;s for autistic faggots who have never so much as touched a girl.
Faster web browser.And yes, it does have gaymes (even its own, exclusive sort), and can use much of Windows and Mac software.

Are we entering the age of ultra-portability?Is the end of Macbook near with the introduction of the Zenbook, Swift 7, Spectre 13 and XPS 13?
how long did it take those computers to be released after apple created the first ultrabook with the MacBook Air?
kek
lol

What&#039;s next, a Macbook with no ports, cumbersome wireless charging + 50$ bluetooth usb adapter?
I have now seen the future and it&#039;s fucking awful.

Hey /gee/ what&#039;s your opinion on ultrabooks?I&#039;m currently looking to buy one but I don&#039;t see too much talking about them in this board.
Too thin that can&#039;t be used for anything other then basic development. Seriously ultrabooks are the fucking future, but at this point notebooks is still the standard.
It&#039;s just a &#039;meme&#039;.Nobody cares how thin your laptop is unless you are extremely mentally ill (ie homosexual). Get a proper one that you can actually use
There&#039;s plenty of ultrabooks with a battery life that would rival any standard 15.6&quot; laptop. Even early Spectres etc would have hours of battery life, and i7 + SSD is quick in any machine.
I get to use quite a few Ultrabooks, running a PC repair shop, and the XPS 13 looks gorgeous, but I wasn&#039;t a fan of the keyboard. Everything was great, but I couldn&#039;t get up to speed typing on that thing. I&#039;ve found most fall down on their keyboard. The HP Spectre XT was really pretty, good spec, cheap for what it was, but the keyboards are all 2mm crappy keys like on an ATM. For me that&#039;s a no-go. I want the input on my machines to be as good as it can be, not fumbling around with keys and making typos etc.
Hmmm....okNot going to buy a current one when this one goes. I&#039;ve been happy with it but, the compromises in simple viewing comfort and lack of 9 key pad.....the little niggling annoyances somehow overshadow the fact it&#039;s provided full functionality while traveling 80% of the last 6 years. Going bigger and cheaper next purchase.
Without the MacBook Air there wouldn&#039;t have been any Ultrabook.
So I&#039;ve bought into the Ultrabook meme and have been looking at machines to buySomething just feels off about paying less for what seems like more, what&#039;s the catch?
Extremely useful or pointless?I&#039;m on the start of chapter 3 (about page 250 or something) and it&#039;s introducing assigned variabes in a convoluted way

If you want to think of yourself as some sort of a magician that does strange stuff , while in reality you type letters on a keyboard, then yes , this book is good.

Here&#039;s a picture of my second problem.
RT-N16 running dd-wrt mega since 2011.  feels great.
installing custom firmware to your router should be illegal
At least Ubunquity devices have a Cisco IOS-type shell

 deny ip 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255 any
Seriously kids; fuck everything except pfsense. You dont have to buy their hardware; it can be virtualized or ran on any x86 hardware (also recently released arm hardware/support).
pfsense is a gooey interface meme. if you cant setup a router from a vanilla bsd/debian install using iptables and vim, you don&#039;t belong in this thread
your router is overpriced for Bing a nuc kys
laughingsluts.jpg
&gt;&gt;&gt;/rapeg/
serious question, why?
You can modify your radio signal causing it to jam a watch tower causing planes to fly with out lane guidance
what&#039;s the hardware?
Never used Debian as a router. Is it as safe and sound as bsd?
At least he doesn&#039;t have a cock in his ass.
huh, cool - but that&#039;s like saying I can stab someone in the neck with a pencil so all pencils should be illegal
Now how well does this work?
we got ASICs for a reason
There&#039;s a difference between radio firmware and operating system firmware.  Radio firmware isn&#039;t open source and is generally completely separate from the OS.
9/10 chance poster you replied to just bricked his own router because he didn&#039;t read the instructions and blames the firmware.  Is what I came up with.
All yall niggas are stupid. Buy a real cisco or something, the 3650g&#039;s are going for ~500$ surplus rn
cisco is not relevant anymore after the backdoor fiasko
Im about to get my CCNA cert. Is it worth to start building a server rack with cisco equipment like a single 2960 Catalyst switch and a 1941 router.Also I think itd be pretty badass to have set up all that myself.
Also, I heard the ISP collects data through your network. If I set up some kind of network segmentation using VLANS would that help?
how retarded are you
What are the chances I will be working with cisco stuff when I get a job? My school only teaches cisco based networking, and I have no experience in anything but cisco.
probable
Yes, Debian is good.
total noob who is looking for a cheap/solid dual-band DSL router/modemany recs?
I had Win 8.1 running VMware workstation running ESXi running Sophos running my gatewayno lic  tho so no updates
how&#039;s your first day on Cisco IOS going?
them cheap linksys ones and such, no ?
what do you guys think of tenda

is that dual-band?
only the AC monster version
the way that guy has it you might as well not have a single statement in the ACL because you will get the same results regardless of if you are applying it to a distribute list, VACL, route-map, interface, management interface, or anything else really.
jesus fuck that&#039;s disgusting
For that to work there still has to be at least 1 rule in the VACL.

shud be fun, thx
I am personally all for this. We need more generals not about buying shit.
seriously, go back to wherever you came from because you are a fucking tool
if you don&#039;t like generals, leave because they&#039;ve been a massive part of 4chan for years now and there are other chan boards out there
It&#039;s promising (and pfsense on a potato would be better than consumer garbage) but I&#039;d like to see it on better hardware. They have an arm-based device for ~$150 (kek) that can handle a ~300Mb WAN.


Guy is a dick but pretty much spot on. You&#039;re probably thinking VPN rather than VLAN. VLANs segment your internal network. Regardless your ISP knows where you&#039;re going and undoubtably logs activity, and there&#039;s what we already know the NSA (and/or other nation states) are doing... and then what we don&#039;t know.
We use no Cisco equip (by choice), but our ISP&#039;s IAD is a Cisco so we&#039;ve got it in the rack.


fuck you, I&#039;m using a small edgerouter x for wired stuff and an asus with advanced tomato as AP. Everything works fine.
A cheap ass chink 20usd 100/100 router and a highend gigabit switch.What speed do I get?

feelsgood.jpg
what a fucking shitty company. they say it is a &quot;carrier class&quot; router, but it only has 1GbE. It has &quot;carrier class&quot; reliability which they think is only 3 nines (8.76 hours downtime per year). they claim their lowend devices are capable of 1 Mpps, which i can only assume is with zero services enabled.
Pic related, was about $360 on Ebay for the 3 switches and routers. The ASA was $160 and came with a good license.
Care to make some guides OP?
you are a dumb cunt if you use this outside a household. I also have an edgerouter lite somewhere, I do believe it&#039;s better for the X but it&#039;s a bit bigger. The wireless links are fucking great. Using internet with one of those with POE and it&#039;s more than enough for my 10mbps internet connection.
you know there is a keygen for ASAs? at least all that old gear was cheap. youll probably pay more powering it than you did for it

Doesnt that rack get noisy in a home?
Not that anon but for 1U cisco switches with blowers, theyre actually pretty quiet. 1U ASAs can be too if you replace the fans. I&#039;m guessing the routers arent horrible since they have 60-80mm fans
but the fucking Catalyst 3550 sounds like a damn hurricane even an hour after it boots up
it shouldn&#039;t. my 3560g and 3750e are both quiet, and yours uses the same fan. if you run &quot;sh env fan&quot; does it say your fan is ok?
why are you still using ipv4 on the inside of your network?
just run &quot;sh env all&quot; and post it here to see what the temperature thresholds are at
I didn&#039;t mean internet traffic. I meant how every communication between devices in my home passes through the ISP provided router. I&#039;d rather only traffic exiting my network pass through my ISP.
then buy a switch you tard
it seems to be fine
wndr3400v3.
meh, guess it doesnt have temp sensors? if you get a 3560g or 3750e they are pretty quiet.
what&#039;s a reasonable AC router right now?im looking to get one.
Ubiquiti UniFi is the Apple of networking (and I mean that in the good ways). It&#039;s got a nice UI (does what I need it to do), solid hardware (nice metal and solid plastic work), still has core features (not that I really need to touch it much). It&#039;s a little overkill for the home, but it satisfies my needs well.I&#039;m much happier with this than shitbox consumer crap that breaks constantly, and even over price enterprise shit you have to be paid for to upkeep.

Follow me on Instagram!
It&#039;s more like Mac in that it works out of the box and is hard to mess up. Just do what the instructions say to do and it just works.
/rape/
Basically plug and forget.
That&#039;s a problem that exists on nearly ALL floss router os, it doesn&#039;t change the functionality.
Not everyone is a poorfag whose work time costs shit nothing.
That&#039;s why everyone else in your network hates you.
A good sentence. Sad that you had to ruin it by mentioning you use a mac unironically.
Guess what, I use 1000€ server hardware for a pfsense installation.
Does anyone know if that unifi central router is worth it?
I just have a RT-AC68U. What the hell are you guys doing?
not buying asus shitboxes
what&#039;s an affordable router with a SFP slot that can handle 1Gbps?
What makes this a shitbox?
it will break soon after warranty ends. t: former asus router owner
I got it when it came out in 2014, and it&#039;s almost 2017. Nice try.
You can get a professionally router for the same amount of money.
That line alone in the ads should make you realize it is for tech illiterate consumer fucks.
We have Linux boxen at work as routers, moving from Cisco to Cumulus because it&#039;s better and open
There is GNS3 that saved you lots of money
Is there any meaningful difference in performance between ac68u and r7000?
Ran a 2 mw data center on vyatta.
Hey guys I was wondering what I could do to get wires internet in another room of my house without snaking a 100ft Ethernet. There was a modem and router in there once but then it was moved to a more central location. Could I just get another modem and plug it in where the old one was?
GNS3 doesn&#039;t have switch emulation.

It&#039;s quite simple really. If you edit someone else&#039;s code to make it pretty or edit config files you use vim. If you actually code then you use emacs.

It sounds silly but this is actually true. Learning Go made me feel feels I haven&#039;t felt since I was a spotty 13 year old clumsily taking my first forays into programming with YABASIC. I realised programming hasn&#039;t been fun for me for years, and learning Go was cathartic on a base level.

Nothing. Crystal will completely curb stomp it, as it has generics and macros while filling the same niche.

It&#039;s a dumbed-down java. If you can afford java or .net devs there is no reason to settle for less, if you&#039;re on a budget though and have to train a team out of scraps from the bottom of the barrel it might come in handy.
You should read CSP, it&#039;s what go is based off of (theory, anyway).
It&#039;s actually closer to C than any other language, and is most inspired by C.

Unhelpful compiler errors make it difficult to learn a language, as anyone who has made a typo in C++ code using templates will know. In C, for example, function and global variable declarations have almost the same syntax. This means that the compiler can’t easily tell which one you meant if you make an error. It gives you helpful error messages like “expected ;” on a line where you don’t think a semicolon is expected at all. The Go grammar was designed to make it possible for the compiler to tell you more accurately what you did wrong. It was also designed to avoid the need to state something that can be easily inferred. For example, if you create a variable and set its value to 42, the compiler could probably guess that this variable should be an integer, without it being explicitly stated. If you initialize it with a function call, then the compiler can definitely tell that the type should be whatever the function returned. This was the same problem that C++ 2011 solves with the auto type.

A woman will never talk to you about your C++ sticker.

Why don&#039;t all languages have cute animal mascots?

Structures in Go are somewhat richer than C structures. One of the most important differences is that Go structures automatically support data hiding. Any top-level type, method, or variable name that starts with a capital letter is visible outside of the package in which it is declared. Thisextends to structure fields. In C, if you only put some fields from a structure in a header, then you will encounter problems when someone tries to allocate an instance of it on the stack: his compiler won’t allocate enough space for it. Go packages export the offsets of the public fields. This allows them to be created and their public fields accessed from other compilation units.
LOOK EVERYONE THIS GUY IS SMARTER THAN PROFESSORS WHO TEACH CS AT CAMBRIDGE, BETTER NOT LEARN GO!!11
Im still waiting for something like love2d in go
If you’re coming from C++, then you should use interfaces in most of the places where you’d use templates in C++. Rather than defining template functions or classes (which Go doesn’t support), define an interface that specifies the set of methods that you need, and use it where you would use the template parameter in C++
This is much more straightforward than C++ or Java.
Friendly reminder Hoare couldn&#039;t into functional programming.
The error output makes it a joy to use to be fair, I really appreciate it after years of C++. They&#039;re close to Ada&#039;s level of readability. Ada makes me laugh because the error messages are so on-point that I start to wonder why the compiler doesn&#039;t just fix the source for you.
after all why DO when you can TEACH right?
CSP defines a functional language to illustrate the theory behind concurrent models.
I&#039;m gonna go code some Go while my girlfriend gives me a bj (and yes, she&#039;s a real woman, born with a vagina, not a penis).


And what failsafes does Go have exactly? It&#039;s literally a minimalist version of java. It still has null pointers and shared memory concurrency along with a weak type system. Go is less safe than Java.

Is golang a good language to learn as a beginner?
Convince me that it&#039;s good using code snippets.
There&#039;s no reason why you couldn&#039;t. The concurrency side of things might make your head hurt as a beginner, but this is normal. I&#039;ve been programming for 15 years and concurrency still occasionally makes my head hurt.

Honestly if I was just starting out all over again, I&#039;d pick C and stick with it for a year. Then I&#039;d move on to other langs.
t. Lisp weenie
I think it gives you intuition and better problem solving skills.
Go is a great language for beginners.
Anyone got any golang ebooks?

Why waste time with useless customizing that doesn&#039;t change functionality?

Ayyy, great game and possibly even greater OST
i got ss rank on most of the levels, but i haven&#039;t played it in a long time so i&#039;m sure they&#039;ve added more
Well.. good thing that there is no such thing as too much ricing
You could do something productive instead
That&#039;s the dumbest shit I have heard
After setting up my phone again after a mobo swap today,  I&#039;ve forgotten about just how much customization I have to do to  just make the fucking thing look default and the way Im used to.
Depends on the definition of ricing. Building your own startpage and working on the CSS for seven hours or doing other /g/ desktop thread tier bullshit is of course retarded, but setting up a DM, WM and essential accessories properly is perfectly reasonable and required to be productive. Since you hopefully backup and sync your dotfiles, you only have to do it once as well.
If you turn your computer on for the only purpose of using your computer, you&#039;re doing something wrong.
I use awesomewm and don&#039;t really care what the background is because it&#039;s covered by windows at all times. I don&#039;t bother with transparency, pseudo or otherwise.
fonts and colors (depending on which colors you change) can help you get less eye strain, letting you work more time.

Hey, came here looking for IEM advice.Posting this again because while I wrote my post in the old thread this one was linked without me noticing
Reminder that he is in a hotel room, which means he brought all that shit with him on a trip.
How do we stop the audiofool problem?

It&#039;s too much for an old husk
wtf is this? r u drunk m8?
Not exactly headphone, but... Looking for a mixer (wrong term?) that will take two audio inputs and properly blend them to a single output device.  Inputs are a cable box and a PC, each with RCA and optical outputs.  The output device will probably end up being a set of Sennheiser RS 165 RF wireless headphones (unless there are good reasons to stay away from them).

hi akg shill
Anyone have a suggestion for a cheap amp to use with my computer (computer --&gt; 3.5mm jack --&gt; amp --&gt; headphones)? Don&#039;t care too much about quality but prefer it to be cheap instead.Thanks!

Define cheap.
How about you give us an actual budget. &#039;Cheap&#039; is entirely subjective.
hi beyerdynamic shill akg shill highfi shill sony shill
No, they are fine.  Objectively and by every metric.  There are plenty of phones that are equally good or better, but that doesn&#039;t make them not fine.

You didn&#039;t quote that post.
Are there any non-terrible wireless IEMs?
No.
Anyone on the Smyth Realiser preorder?Anyone have a portable they like as much as or more than the O2 (ideally that will run low impedance loads)?
Is $50 too cheap? Somewhere around there... is cheaper even possible?!
buy these, they are crisp and bassy lol

Schiit Fulla [not the second model] can be found for cheap too as theyre being cleared out.
Those are the only ones I&#039;ve tried at the price that I actually like.
He&#039;s asking about amps.
Thank goodness you&#039;re here.
You&#039;re welcome.

I&#039;d really like a recommendation for which kit is the best.
Can&#039;t find these anywhere selling to the UK.
Both need shielding from EMI though. A grounded sheet of sandwich foil fixes it.
Do any of them come with 1/4&quot; plugs for headphone input btw?
DIY O2 doesnt come with a case or knob btw
Eric Clapton&#039;s Unplugged album is fantastic.  Even if you don&#039;t like his music, or how it was &quot;mastered&quot; it&#039;s a fantastic album.  A good system will revel space and intimacy that you can&#039;t hear on a crappy car system, but it&#039;s not like the music disappears on a crappy car system.  The groove is still there.  FUCK go listen to some Zydeco and tell me how important your headphones are.
The O2 is really really good.  Make the funds happen.  Millett&#039;s Butte is a good opamp headphone amp but it&#039;s not much cheaper (and don&#039;t skimp on the caps).
I just got a thinkpad what music player should I put on it? Is there any way to transfer music to an ipod besides itunes?

For what headphone?
yeah that&#039;s what I use on my desktop, put that on like 3 years ago was checking to see if anything better came out but it doesn&#039;t look like it lmao

My point to people who are stressing about some audio decision is that in general you aren&#039;t going to get the right thing the first time, and it takes experience with a lot of gear to have a sense of what works for you and what doesn&#039;t so just try a bunch of stuff and decide what you like.  Probably should have lead with that.
Might want to ask /mu/ maybe?
Get over yourself pal
I wouldn&#039;t recommend velours on closed cans for most cases.
Not a question about headphones specifically, but about a DAC/AMP for my new Massdrop AKG K7XXsIs there anything that would be a quality of life improvement from the Fiio E10K at around the 100ish mark? The onboard sound of my computer has an audible hiss, so I need both a DAC and an AMP, hopefully in one. I know that something like an AudioEngineD1 or Schiit Stack would be ideal, but I&#039;m tied a bit for cash.
Schiit Fulla. Uses same DAC as in the stacks. Well worth the money and it&#039;d easily beat an E10k in both sound and power.
random asf, he&#039;s just saying that there are different tiers and levels of enjoyment, when you&#039;re eating in michelin starred restaurants you can also enjoy the shack around the corner, but having everyone condone the shack over the starred chefs is just shitposting for the masses aka what&#039;s best for the majority is the best for the individual
Fulla 2, not the original Fulla.
Only headphones I could feasibly see myself getting after these AKGS, if any, would be like some Senny HD650s or 600s. Probably not though. Would either Fulla run those? This may sound dumb, sorry.
I hate /mu/ i&#039;m just going to stay with foobar
/mu/ loves musicbee as well. That&#039;s breddy alright
No actually, the people who don&#039;t care too much have it right.  It&#039;s like a bell curve.  Just enjoy your shit and don&#039;t get all strung out by people telling you your shit is bad.  Basically the opposite of what you seemed to get out of it.  And the only reason I brought up the business is because I literally spend 9.7 hours of every work day critically listening to shit.
is soulseek okay to use? Been using it for a while and always find the hard to find shit on there. Is it safe to use? Are there better options for free music? I don&#039;t want to have to share shit on a private torrent group or something I hated what.cd

sorry.
As a note, Soundmagic E10S is the one with the mic.
Tangent.  I have one of the old Panasonic Plasmas that I like a lot, but it&#039;s going to die one day and there really aren&#039;t any more plasmas.  What do I do for sub $4k if I want the blackest of blacks that ever blacked.  And the ability to turn off motion smoothing/frame doubling.
So yea, I&#039;d wait for the 2 to come back into stock,
I&#039;m pretty close to retarded, so I don&#039;t know If I feel I could really do that. Also, isn&#039;t the O2 the Objective2 + ODAC? Am I getting memed on? It looks like that&#039;s 280 everywhere I&#039;ve looked...
o2 = Objective 2
Oh shit, nvm I just found it. I&#039;ve never seen it as two separate things. I figured they were always together. I need a DAC as well, to eliminate the hiss from my actual computer though :(
What do you faggots even listen to, vaporwave and video game soundtracks? Jesus Christ.
I wasn&#039;t that guy. I was just explaining. Dunno why he was suggesting just an o2.
i&#039;d add anime soundtracks and kpop to that list
I have tall ears, so want something with logitech-size over-ear cups. I&#039;m split between getting a headset or getting headphones and an external mic, I need a half-decent mic for /tg/ stuff, and my Plantronics mic was easily good enough for that (while it worked). Thoughts?
What exactly is the point in getting a higher end DAC, as opposed to say the Fulla2 or the Fiio E10K? Is there a noticeable cleanliness upgrade? An increase in certain things? I get the AMP part, more power, or getting a tube amp to color the sound, but DACS?
Higher end amps are also because less distortion
listened to this today and saw that he&#039;s re-releasing the album on February of next year, since he is under a different record company. I&#039;m contemplating checking the archive for it before hand tho. The tracks he has on spotify are pretty interesting.
Ah, thanks!
Does it get better at any point or I just have fucked up ears/my expectations aren&#039;t realistic?
Honestly I like my O2+ODAC more than the Grace m903s we use at work.
What do you have?
So if you like your rig and it&#039;s cheap then that&#039;s fine, stick with enjoying what you have until you find a reason to change it.
Dunno man, my ears are very sensitive and I can hear the faintest shit, maybe that&#039;s why I&#039;m picking up all those sound imperfections? Like I find it hard to listen to someone when there&#039;s a background noise, the noise overpowers that voice and they mix up. Headphones just sound unnatural, like there&#039;s a constant background white noise and the sound is all &quot;grainy&quot;.
If you are ill like I am. Try this. This might sound stupid. Tell me if your RCA cable is seperate or both are attached to each other. If attached together plug it in and listen. When you&#039;re done remove them. Switch the direction around. If you hear something slightly different. Then you are ill.
They&#039;re separate but I don&#039;t see how that would make any difference, unless the cables are physically different, which I doubt.

I actually listen to plenty to classical stuff (FLAC) but the same issues are present, just to a lesser degree.
I browsed these threads years ago when I got my o2/odac + dt880 setup but i&#039;m not privy to anything new. are there any better headphones for $200 or so?
Selling Audeze LCD-2(like New), pls checkout my listing on eBay.
*unsheathes dick*
It&#039;s not my recording, but essentially it&#039;s recorded really close with a lot of signal.  Most symphonic recordings are not done that way because the engineer is trying to capture the &quot;room&quot; which is what I suspect sound grainy to you.  Things recorded really close may be your jam.  Try getting out to a few classical concerts or jazz concerts and see if the same things bother you (audience noise may be the biggest bother to you).  And then, honestly, begin recording your own stuff.  Go meet good musicians and learn to get the sound you want.  That&#039;s only one recording but I listen to it all the time because I love how intimate it is.  It never ceases to satisfy.
Hey I’m thinking about buying myself a pair of open back cans for xmas. I’m mainly into bass heavy edm genres and pop. I’ve had Sennheiser 598HDs and audiotechnica’s ath-m50s and I’me veering more towards sennheiser in terms of sound characteristics. Right now I have a sad Fioo Q1 amp and am wondering if I should just invest in a better amp instead of getting a new pair of cans. I was looking at the Sennheiser 600’s and the BeyerDynamic DT 880 premium series. I’m thinking this amazon deal is currently my best bet as they look like good bundle. Btw I can&#039;t do paypal and currently have an amazon credit card so they&#039;re the vendor i&#039;m stuck with.
I&#039;ve heard the x2&#039;s are really good for edm, and they probably won&#039;t need an amp either.
So what&#039;s the next step up from the HD600/O2 setup? Should I look into Stax?
HD650/Fulla 2
thanks Ill take a look at em!
Is there a term for this kind of recordings or something?
I&#039;m going to get into music production and I&#039;m about to pull the trigger on some MSR7 first before getting a more proper setup (amp, etc). Is there a better pair of cans in that price range (&lt;250USD) or are these the best I can get without an amp?
My favorite cheap reference is the etymotic ER4s.  They are by no means flat but they have good clarity and they do not encourage you to artificially bump anything.  Make sure to check your Lfe on some speaker system that can move air though because you may be overdriving it.
That&#039;s like rabbi level of savings.

Pretty dumb question but is there any &lt;$100 iem that sounds as good as the ve monk? I just borrow it from my friend who&#039;s into chinkshit and i actually like it more than my se215, not even joking
Didn&#039;t mean to quote
No idea.  I have ER4Ps and JH13s.  The ER4Ps hold up well considering the massive price difference.  Haven&#039;t played with many other IEMs in the last four years, did a bit back when I was deciding if I wanted to spend the coin on the JH13s.
Thanks for the information by the way, it&#039;s nice to discover something actually related to music instead of shilling and memes.

Why are you still here shilling the lackluster FOTM &quot;flagships&quot;?
August EP650, that&#039;s it.
Did you like the amount of bass? if so, have a look at XB950 or VModa Crossfade M-100
Well, I didn&#039;t solely buy them because of that, and I think I&#039;m looking more for a clear sound than for bass and I&#039;d probably give up some of that for clear sound, which is why I wanted to know if the ATH-M50X is a good buy, since I heard it&#039;s all around balanced.
Give me opinions on HE-400s and ATH-MSR7 plox.
tyll said they are are the best though and he doesn&#039;t fall for flavor of the month.
if you want something more neutral with still a slight bass boost, have a look at HM5/XPT100
The 553 is basically a worse DT770. It&#039;s not an alternative to the MSR7 in sound or size.
I&#039;m really not super sure because I want good quality on bass mid and treble but I do like the bass to be a little more pronounced. The artists I listen to range from Ween to Marina and the Diamonds to A$AP Rocky to Daoko to Marvin Gaye and everything in between. basically a little bit of everything. Thanks in advance.
momentum in ear or cx 5.0? which is better generally speaking?

If not what didn&#039;t you like about it
I commute a lot, so I&#039;m hoping for something sturdy and isolated. Also considering in getting BoomPros eventually.
What&#039;s wrong with them?
That&#039;s a pretty accurate description imo. K553 just falls short in consistency and instead of being the usual V-shaped headphone it is when it seals properly, it goes into being a bright nobass one. DT770 doesn&#039;t suffer from this level of inconsistency in seal. DT770 also is quite often regarded as more comfortable but that&#039;s subjective.
/hpg/ agrees on nothing and definitely doesn&#039;t see eye to eye with Tyll or about Tyll. Some have a pet peeve with him talking about technical things he doesn&#039;t understand(like square waves). I&#039;d hope most here realize that things like HOF is simply his opinion on things, his subjective outlook on some product and it really doesn&#039;t correlate with how everyone else perceives it.
maybe get hm5 pads to go along with it if they aren&#039;t comfy enough
Would the DT990 be a viable option? They are on sale in my local Amazon.

Etymotic HF5 and MK5 are flatter. Generally more isolating, but the cables can be very annoying. Not everyone likes their fit, but the small body can be fairly comfy.
normally I wouldn&#039;t mind about like 10-20 difference but this is to put on a wish list and there&#039;s a budget of 25€, so people will probably throw a shitfit if I put on a 40€ thing
This might not be the right place but I could really use some buying advice. I&#039;m looking for a high end usb microphone and I&#039;m leaning Blue Yeti. Before I get called out for falling for a meme, know that I can get a brand new one for only $84.99.

Not everyone has the budget or space for studio broadcasting equipment. Maybe people just want those on the other end to be absolutely sure the speaker is taking the lords name in vain and insulting their mother.
at2020 best
Realize that a company building a USB microphone (or any &quot;digital interface&quot; microphone) has the ability to tune the preamp stage to exactly match the microphone.  Now they have to care to do this but Blue does and their stuff is great for the price.

Will it damage my open-back headphones if I crank the volume really high and use them as speakers?
yes
Hello!
At some point any speaker will fail, but maybe it can be okay if you use it within a few feet.
The blue will be good.  Good people too, not a huge company like AT, although I like everything AT I&#039;ve ever bought.  Got a pile of AT microphones and used to own AT headphones.
im coming from akg 240s btw
I can understand meme shit like Orpheus since it comes with special equipment to drive them, but generic headphones?
Why do these come in 250 ohms version? What&#039;s the fucking point? So they fuck you into buying an amp???Also, how good are they?
I have a quality headphone amp.Should I invest in some good nearfield speakers, or a DAC first? Current DAC is whatever is onboard an ASUS Z170 mobo.
if you have an amp and bring a portable amp with you or you never plan to use them on the go there&#039;s literally no reason to not get 250s
I have the DT250/250 and ran them against the DT250/80s and there was a clear difference.  As long as you are always on power they are worth it, if you want to use them as a portable or without an amp then get the 80, they are fine.
dt 770

Gracias we :3
&quot;&gt;Budget&quot;
just bought these for 60 euros, did i do good?
go for the K550
Brainwavz HM5
These are made in different impedances so producers can choose the optimal option for their studio&#039;s particular setup.
DT880
theyre fine if you put HM5&#039;s on them, but even then theyre outdone by MDR 7506 for cheaper
I&#039;d go with HM5 hybrids for them tho
Ok, how about I found them more comfy than my HD280s?  Better?
XLR microphones give better results since you have a multitude of controls
Fill out a form.
the 250 ohm variants are better than the 80
DT880 or K702 or DT250
Yes. They&#039;re a great closed headphone.
Eh, I could see that. 280&#039;s have insane clamp which affects people with big heads pretty badly. I&#039;d still take any of the 4XX series over m50x for comfort
Is there a point in owning the DT 880 600ohms and the HD600?
Le kek
Both at once? Probably not. Keep whatever one you prefer. If you like one for one circumstance and the other for another circumstance, keep both.

K702
The price tag is one of the selling points for some people.

If you&#039;re even thinking about grades it&#039;s clear your piano playing is nothing but a hobby.
I don&#039;t think you should worry too much about the DAC.
very good

Anyone have the Rhode NT-usb microphone?I want to use it about 50cm from my mouth. Would that be too far? A sound sample would be fantastic.
mainly for work and commuting purposes as i do a lot of phone calls.
anybody got that webm of the autistic reviewer flinching while listening to a pair of headphones?
If you are on a budget (up to 50$) get these: &quot;Koss Porta Pro&quot;They might look a little uhm weird, but they sound quite good (for the price)
This is the fundamental disassociation.  A good engineer will benefit from a multitude of controls, the typical home user is usually better served by something done for them by an engineer.  This is the same problem with cars, you go bolt on new shocks, springs, and bigger breaks thinking &quot;ooh I&#039;m so elite.&quot; and ruin the handling.
On Ear, cable not detachable, come with a bag and you are able to fold em up
mdr-100aap  opinion?
Is sound intone i66 a decent budget earphones? I&#039;m in love with the pink one...
I&#039;m researching and it sounds like the HM5 has rather weak bass. I wonder if I should be considering the HM9 instead, or if it goes too far. I havent really explored enough to say for sure but I think it is midbass/lower midrange that I like, so I guess I should be describing it as warm, and I definitely detest sibilance.
I found a pair of beyerdynamic dt 770 80 ohms locally for 90 bucks in box. Is this the best bassy headphones I&#039;ll find for under 100? I just need comfort, good bass and decent noise isolation.
Yes, for that price they are great.
What kind of cans are essential for listening to Primus?
Alright cool I&#039;ll for it then. Do you happen to know if the black version still uses velour for the pads? They just look less fluffy but it could just be the color.
fml
Sorry dude, don&#039;t really know about the pads.
Impulse bought my first speakers...fuck I hope they&#039;re not big
It&#039;s a circumaural design, but I have an application where I would prefer a supra-aural design.  Does anyone know which Sony supra-aural model is the closest thing to MDR-V6?
both would they be that different? everybody seems to like the HD600 better
Anyone know what the deal with these limited edition pro 80s is? Are they any different than the originals? Better or worse? Think they&#039;re made in China instead of Germany?
New thread
sound wise theyre identical to the 80 ohm standard 770&#039;s.
When will the most fundamental x86 patents expire so one no longer needs a license to create a cpu with at least x86-64 and SSE2 compatibility?

I have a 120gb Sandisk ssd, but the Samsung Evo 500gb for $170 is tempting, should I get it?
no
SATA SSD is quickly getting left far behind in speed.If you&#039;re getting a new one, then get a blazing fast m.2 model.
What if i&#039;m stuck with a 10gbps m.2 slot? Is it still worth it?
Don&#039;t just get &quot;an m2 drive&quot; because that could be just as fast as SATA, or even literally is SATA if you get the wrong one
 is already hitting 15-25Gbps, if you get an m2 drive worth having you&#039;re not gonna be able to utilize it yet
But you still have bragging rights with your &quot;blazing fast m.2 model&quot;.
Yeah... I just got an SSD M.2 and the write speeds seem like shit... right? Or am I just an idiot?

AMD&#039;s acquisition of ATI will make them the dominant player in both the GPU and CPU market. Mark my words.
Try the one where you uninstall Windows 10, install Linux, and get a Conky theme instead.
It&#039;s only going to get better! You&#039;ll see in 2-3 years time!
Disgusting.
what did you have in mind?

Will a scheduled Windows update wake my computer from sleep on W10?  Noticed it kept waking up until I eventually just decided to shut it down right before I was going to go to bed.  Not sure if it was some misconfigured peripheral that was getting input somehow (though I already have it set not to wake from mouse movements so it&#039;s not that) or if it was a scheduling thing.
Oh nevermind, just answered my own question, found the &quot;Reboot&quot; task on Task Scheduler which was indeed set up to wake the computer from sleep, now this has been fixed.
I got this thing and was thinking of installing Linux on it. I&#039;m a babby so is Linux Mint good?

Does it make me a bad person if I am disgusted by homosexuals?I mean I know in the rational part of my brain that I shouldn&#039;t discriminate against them and that they have done nothing wrong, but there is still a very strong disgust tied up deeply in my subconscious somehow that I just can&#039;t get past.
Do other languages have their own types of coding language, or does everyone code in English? For example, is there a French version of Javascript?
For the most part I think English is standard.

Is this considered damage? Probably not because it always happens with every card/device.

technically, the surface is being scratched, but it&#039;s normal behaviour, the card will likely fail in another way before the pads wear out

What backup programs do people usually recommend for small folders and backing up often?
How bad is the vive/oculus resolution when reading in general? Will I be able to watch movies without being disgusted? What about reading anime subtitles? Should I consider the vive/oculus only for playing games?
Oculus is 1080 x 1200 for each eye so I would think it would be plenty for doing what you mentioned.
how can I view a website without actually going to it
See if it&#039;s saved in google cache or archive.org or something similar, I guess.  Though I&#039;m not 100% certain that those services won&#039;t try to load some assets from the live server, so be cautious.

On windows, i just download and compile a portable version of something, and run it inside a folder.
there&#039;s nothing a configure script can do that a portable windows program can&#039;t
How about looking at the configure script you retard?
Now for a portable windows application which is also open source, modifying anything outside the folder it is run in IS considered malicious, and so doesn&#039;t happen.
There&#039;s simply too much code to look through it all.
It&#039;s just running a KMS licensing service that your pc validates itself against instead of an external server.
Is there a website like 10 minutemail but provides a fake mobile number for websites that require activation?

http://smspva.com
i don&#039;t know where you got your information from, but you can do portable applications in linux in exactly the same way as in windows, most programs don&#039;t change the system-wide PATH definitions or touch crontab, nor do they have or need write access to any system files in general
I mean a good one
mostly going to blog(game reviews and stuff)
Okay, so how do i install a portable ssh server on a linux system without running any scripts?
Anyone have:sb_n_x64
This is mainly why i hate linux. Its basically an OS where you run scripts and hope nothing breaks.
you&#039;re willing to run the resulting binary, but not the compilation scripts shipped with the same program, written by the same people?
Cant i just place it inside without the adapter or it must be a perfect fit?
it must be a perfect fit, or be held to place to make contact with the pins
Hi UK anon, probably Mydigitallife forums have it.
I realize thinkpads are the /g/ meme laptops, but what about other kinds like elitebook/probook/latitude and such? Are they somehow worse than thinkpads, since thinkpads get an entire thread to themselves?
All you can do is just throw applications together in the same system and let the scripts do their thing.
HP is decent, but not the best, their consumer line is shit, mostly because shitty cooling.
I assume my carrier has them but probably will try to sell me a new SIM.
Pretty much the only upgrade you need to buy is an SSD
idk you probally could half ass a solution with cardboard or something, just google it.
I&#039;m just unclear on wether Latitudes are as easy to replace parts and have as good Linux support or not. I&#039;d assume so, but I&#039;m a bit of an idiot so I&#039;d rather not take any chances. Battery life is also somewhat important, but I&#039;d think that they&#039;re kind of similar among all kinds of work laptops.

My old mechanical keyboard has a slightly lose wire so on occasion it will unplug itself. Normally its a slight inconvenience but lately if I replug it in while windows is running it  won&#039;t respond. Numluck light comes on but nothing else responds until I either restart or switch users. After refreshing my windows it works fine, and I&#039;ve tried it on other pcs and it works fine being plugged/unplugged as the computer is on. So theres some software issue I can&#039;t fucking figure out. Any tips
Okay nevermind for some reason the USB option was highlighted now and I could boot from it

What good quality projector can I get for under under $300 in Australia? Looking to use it over Christmas.
I&#039;m uploading a torrent and it says I&#039;ve uploaded twice the size of the files to one peer who seems to be stuck at 99.6%. Why is this?
the z170 should will be full x16 on the secondary slot
Why do you need Dual x16?
I&#039;ll check mstoolkit out
I&#039;m using NetworkManager and nm-applet for my connection, I have to manually right click + click on my wifi network on startup (it&#039;s set to auto connect in the settings). I&#039;m using Gentoo.The fuck?
MSToolkit can be found in MyDigitalLife Forums.
Awesome, thank you.
The reprint receipt button saves as index.htm and it doesn&#039;t show anything when I open that.
And the third is a x4 slot.
I don&#039;t. I only have one card, but the top slot is blocked by my case. I just need one x16, but I read some boards auto throttle the secondary slot(s) to x8.
I know it&#039;s for windows 7, I have windows 7 and it didn&#039;t want to work

Oh wait disregard that i&#039;m the fucko. Second slot in x8, half the contacts.

It&#039;s something from Finnish that means something like &quot;regards&quot;, as in &quot;regards, a faggot&quot;
I was wrong. Second slot is x8, third is x4. Maybe try a riser if you&#039;re really want it?
Thanks for confirming.

v0 varies and only goes as high as it needs to, which is sometimes 320kbps. There&#039;s no perceptible difference between 320 CBR and v0 VBR.

I have a generic usb laser mouse (no custom driver) that&#039;s been working perfectly for the last 10 months or something. I&#039;m used to hibernating my PC, a windows 7, so it boots faster. Last night I decided to turn it off like I usually do every week or so.I&#039;m a fucking iliterate, so I just took a can of compressed air, blew it directly at the lens, but didn&#039;t fix anything. Then I opened it, blew directly on the sensor, but nothing. You know how the led light goes into a low state when you&#039;re not moving it for a second, and gets brighter as soon as it moves? The thing stays bright 100% of the time when being lifted, with nothing but two meters of air between the closest solid surface and the sensor.
I have my computer speakers connected to my monitor via a 3.5mm cable rather than directly to my tower&#039;s audio output. My PC is connected to the monitor via HDMI. I&#039;m doing this because I have two game consoles connected to the same monitor via HDMI so when I switch video inputs the audio seamlessly outputs via the same speakers. Stupid question: by going PC -&gt; Monitor -&gt; Speakers rather than PC -&gt; Speakers, am I getting considerably worse audio quality by letting the monitor be the middleman?
Anon, compressed air is strong as fuck.

I know /g/ isn&#039;t for tech support but I&#039;m having an issue that no amount of googling is addressing.Is there anything I can check now to see what the issue is? I&#039;ve tried taking the back panel off, but it&#039;s pretty firmly attached even after removing the screws and I&#039;m wary of forcing it off. It&#039;s not covered under warranty any more, and if I do have to send to back for repair, I absolutely must get everything off the SSD and wipe it. Is there any way to recover the data on the SSD and then wipe it if the monitor isn&#039;t working and it doesn&#039;t appear as though any inputs from the keyboard works either?
Because the Chevrolegs work just fine.
Best shorten that shit

If I want to build a mining rig does the quality of the other parts besides the GPU matter?
Should I buy amazon prime so I can get fast and free shipping from Amazon for pc parts or just stick to finding different offers from other websites?
Mining wise not really, as long as they are in good and working condition. You probably don&#039;t want to mine with a faulty PSU, bad RAM etc.
Enjoy never seeing a cent in profit
i got prime by mistake after forgetting to cancel the month free subscription. So far it really comes in handy. you can buy a 5 dollar item pay no shipping and it shows up in less than 24 hours sometimes. and its 8 bucks a year ffs
Have you already used the free trial? Newegg also has a free trial for their prime type service. Additionally, if you have an Amex card you can get shoprunner 2-day for free and it works on newegg.

I&#039;m assuming you meant $8/month? Otherwise please show me how you got this deal.
Porn scanners in the sadpanda thread or Buyfag thread might have an idea on /a/.
Is there any way of changing the &#039;long double&#039; typename to something less cumbersome? Sort of like:Except obviously this doesn&#039;t compile.
heres a link http://a.co/6f2vfYx   gives me 5 bucks credit heh
Cant you just keep on making accounts for the free trial?
I used to have student (they cut me off after 6 years because &quot;graduate students no longer qualify&quot;), and it was $40/year. It says right on your link that it&#039;s $40/year. How do you get $8 from that?

Also you better not to. This is impairing readability.
What duties does a system administrator have, in your experience?
Honestly it&#039;s fairly vanilla by most standards: a bit of questionable porn (trap/futa), questionable (but patrician) anime, and a shit ton of music I&#039;ve pirated, as well as passwords to burner emails/accounts I&#039;ve made for privacy reasons. I just hate the idea of people potentially going through all that information.
Seriosly though - mostly maintaining servers (not much) and dealing with stupid users (alot).
oh sorry 40 a year. still good. still not 8 a month or whatever
Trying to find information on how subnet masks work but any information I find seems to be more complicated than I can comprehend.I really only want to know for due to personal curiosity

Suppose that you PING another computer on the network to test the network and you receive no response, just timeouts. The target computer is running; it&#039;s on a different subnet from the computer you pinged from. The network cable is plugged in, and no firewall is running inside the network. Moreover, the target computer responds to pings from other computers in the same subnet, but cannot be pinged by any computer in a different subnet. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this problem?

What the difference between  mail-client/thunderbird and mail-client/thunderbird-bin ?
One is precompiled and just installs a binary to your system. The other is source and you&#039;re going to compile it locally then install
former is presumably built upon installation, and the latter is a precompiled version
- likely built with lowest-common-denominator, generic cpu features
Very inexperienced when regarding processor choice, everything I hear about nowadays is either AMD or Intel (i5 and i7)halp
2GB RAM*
She doesn&#039;t need anything more powerful than i3. Could even get job done with a celeron and stuff like that. Couple of gigs of RAM and she has everything she needs, bigger concern should be keyboard and screen. I think its always best if you get new stuff rather than used.
A X220 with IPS screen would be good for her too.
the main concerns should be physical robustness and battery life, in this case. unless the machine is more than about 6 years old, it will handle those tasks no problem, especially with an ssd
please respond
Get her a Chuwi Hi10 Pro. Bitches like android and windows tablets with 4Gb of ram
I&#039;m looking for a laptop for basic uni work but I only have a 300€ budget and I would prefer its screen size to be small (12&quot; maximum). Whats the best brand that offers this kind of laptops? Any particular advice?

Probably Dell
For what are you going to use it?
Well, how long should a Thinkpad battery last for it to be considered a good buy? A T410 just caught my eye and the seller says it&#039;s up to 2 hours. Seems lacking...
2. Its probably using a Chinese 6 cell battery.

Check asus too while you&#039;re up there
alright sweet, guessing I should just google openwrt openvpn setup?

why the fuck is svchost using 1.3gb of ram
Windows Update &amp;/Or defender.
1.6 now and 50% cpu time
Stop using programs and doing things on your computer if you dont want for services and programs to use you system

svchost is actually a bunch of processes

Since I&#039;ve switched to linux and don&#039;t play games this massive fuck off tower gaming pc seems pointless, thinking of selling it and building a micro atx build, is there any way to work out how much I should sell it for and should I install windows 7 or 10 on it before selling?
What&#039;s the point of lambda functions? Do they just make it easier to type repetitive Shit? How and when are they used?
why not side boot windows or Vbox windows? IT wouldn&#039;t be that big a deal and a lot of good games are on linux now.
So I&#039;ve bought into the Ultrabook meme and have been looking at machines to buySomething just feels off about paying less for what seems like more,  what&#039;s the catch?
I don&#039;t think you read my question proper or maybe I&#039;m not understanding you, It&#039;ll be harder to sell a pc running linux so I&#039;m asking if I should install windows 7 or windows 10 before selling it
two possibilities the asus is realistically priced and the hp is overpriced or the asus is cheap because it&#039;s got lower build quality etc.
Well ok, I&#039;d say if you want to sell the PC to install 10. NOW the reason behind this is because most people already see 7 as obsolete or put 8.1 which is most computers still. But if you&#039;re selling it to a normie, 8.1 is fine desu senpai.
yea I figured to go 10 or 8.1 normies don&#039;t care if it violates your privacy - I&#039;ll just put whatever I can get cheaper on it

That won&#039;t be a thing if you have to deal with their CS.
If 50ish is your budget check out Plantronics 780/788/400HS. I had a pair of 780s that lasted me 4 years.

where do i put my input.conf for mpv in Windows 10?

What the heck? Programs I use work just fine for me.
They want you to upgrade because they patched a severe security issue that will get you hacked but can&#039;t tell you that in fear of losing their credibility
This pic is sad because it actually came from a Chinese zoo where all the animals were treated like shit. :^(

What if my program doesn&#039;t go online?
fucking chinks
I would throw those people at em. They deserve a good meal once in a while.
Then you do not need to update it, do you?
These Chinks are degenerate as it gets. Terrible culture.
off-topic threadjackers [/blog]
Yeah, but whatever you have there probably goes online to check.
I&#039;m not talking about in-program notifications, I&#039;m talking about /g/.
If you&#039;re using those programs to work on anything worth any value, any of it ever touches a computer with a network connection (any network, not just internet), and ANYONE ELSE happens to know about it, your system is vulnerable to those security issues.
Enjoy your dirty cow
Pick one.
I do not exclude persons from behaving like a responsible and humane being by lowering my standards for them.

Then you have no idea what China is like.  Your standards aren&#039;t relevant, they literally have none.
i would do that too
That was a good read.

off to /csg/ you chink loving fag


How will mactoddlers ever recover?

o-oh ok...
2 rupees have been deposited in your Apple iTunes account Panjeet!
that&#039;s like making a client-server app, saving passwords in plain text and blaming whatever technology you&#039;re using that it&#039;s unsafe when it&#039;s your fault you didn&#039;t encrypt them

btw im not exactly sure why you keep posting that around here, no one could give less of a fuck and when your shit does get here, no one will give a fuck then.
The delivery changed since I initially placed the order.
well hows the desk?
 and they will bend over backwards to find one for you.
You mean &quot;hash&quot;.
btw my model was BTO and they still had it. They will occasionally just tell you &quot;no we only have stock configs&quot; but that&#039;s bullshit.
is there a rule that you must refer to one-way encryption as hashing?
Unfortunately far as fuck away from the nearest Apple store.
meh
Fuck macfags are really dumb consumers.

trash

I use a P50 at work, that shit is fucking amazing. I will probably not build another computer now that I know first hand that laptops are so strong.

nice one u fuckin loser lmao
Fucking moron /v/ babby. You&#039;ll never get it will you? Its so, so simple. People buy Macs for the OS integration. This is just too hard of a concept for you to understand.
Good joke.
Do you ever bring an argument into a thread or do you just post shit off the internet I&#039;ve seen since like 2005? Please give me something to properly respond to. Otherwise I&#039;ll just conclude you&#039;re in poverty and angry. I&#039;ll have no other choice
I more or less agree with you, between two similar laptops I would rather get the Mac. But the P50 is a beast, it just blows the MacBook out of the water.
I wonder if you could make an app that takes control of the bar if nothing else is using it, and plays a cool screensaver-type thing.
This thing can game at top-level right?
y u mad?
Pretty much
You call that intergration? when you can&#039;t even plug in your devices from the same company?
wat. I understand people&#039;s complaint about the ports but this one is stupid –the current &quot;standard&quot; USB-A -&gt; lighting cable is already a cable with two different connectors; a usb-c to lighting cable is available and is the same thing...
wZxxTDPA
Of course it had to be meemees. Why did I expect more?
This board loves to dig through possible scenarios to find ways Apple can go wrong, we all know very well that people barely ever plug their phones into their computers anymore. The only scenario I can think of is if an update bricks your phone. As far as I know there&#039;s still no way to essentially do what Macs can which is download macOS from the BIOS menu.

The world runs on linux, but Macs are better than windows for everything but gaming. They are the patrician choice for home computers unless you&#039;re a developer and need linux.
And until then it will be my anime waifu bar.

how

/g/ went to shit in 2012

and it&#039;s Japanese
This is true, of course Apples best days are over and soon it won&#039;t be so true anymore, but a real /g/ fag knows that, not a chinkpad neckbeard

AAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
What the fuck
Some day I will replace it&#039;s 1TB (this is what real storage looks like) HD with an SSD one, and eventually the battery if I can bother to disassemble it that far. I will have spent barely $1500 in the span of time a mactoddler spends $10,000, and I will have a better computer every step of the way.
Understandable, though, given you are completely and utterly brainwashed by a company to the point of getting you to defend it as if it was a person you have a personal relationship with. Fucking pathetic and sad.
Daily reminder.
Is this bait?
I would rather use an old Toshiba P50 than the repulsive piece of garbage that is the Lenovo P50 I&#039;m typing this message from.
Hope they use AMD Ryzen
Yes. Next question
What did the macfag mean by this?
First thing I noticed were those fucking icons that aren&#039;t straight. My autism is eternally triggered.
And the interaction with the OS is so far from intuitive, it breaks my head how people can accept, yet alone like it.

y u mad tho
Because Applel &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;programmers&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; are a fucking joke, and always have been.
Even applelfags know it&#039;s finished
415$ for a desk? Why?

The Toshiba P50-B is still technically better than current year macbook pro&#039;s though.

probably needs a network drive with configuration info on the school network?
Bump
School&#039;s public IP range?You&#039;ll need access back into their SCCM or other deployment system to boot probably, or spoof it.
No there is no login , it just goes straight to the error message
better focus on your homework, lil underage boy

Jokes on you I already did it
Well that&#039;s what my school has chosen to throw money at.
Depressing. My old work used CC4. Total dogshit

nah
shut up, new fag


How does private trackers banning it&#039;s usage have anything to do with it being better? It&#039;s banned because you can spoof the version. Ironically, this allows you to use it on said trackers. (they&#039;d probably figure it out though)
Otherwise Deluge is great. The daemon is stable and it can be easily scripted
That&#039;s not picotorrent.

I just use rTorrent, I&#039;m happy with its performance.
The aspies on this board. I swear to christ it&#039;s like the rejects from r9k all came together to pretend they know things about technology
this
I need to go throgh hundreds of stuff on my downloads folder every time, and Deluge is forcing me to manually sort my stuff when I just needed to double-click it on uTorrent.
Who are you quoting?
The webUI is slow as balls after 500 torrents
these
You mean ruTorrent?
That&#039;s a weird picture of rTorrent

What does a web interface have anything to do with the discussion?
Does it work with any client other than rtorrent? If not, it&#039;s pretty clear which one he&#039;s referring to.
And that&#039;s goddamn /thread ladies and gentlemen
i use transmission and it jus twerks
what&#039;s with this meme? Is this from reddit? It sounds like it&#039;s from reddit

Not shittier than your &quot;argument&quot;.
Questionable. Libtorrent is shit after all and shouldn&#039;t be used by any sane person. But then again freetards are pretty much the opposite of healthy individuals

Because svchost leaks memory on Windows and requires me to have at least 12gb to even be functional. Thanks microshit.
Because I sometimes have multiple CAD and Photoshop files open, in addition to 20+ Chrome tabs. I have 8GB, and that feels like too little sometimes.
because i have more than one computer

Unused RAM is wasted RAM so therefore unbought RAM is also wasted RAM, meaning you should use as much RAM as your motherboard support.

Vivaldi is comfy, COMFY!
X is y, Y !
But it&#039;s unresponsive as shit desu
fuckin love this meme tbqf :)
Downloading to try now, coming from Opera which I feel like they have kind of gimped how it handles downloads. I don&#039;t want it to show me my files in a tab just let my OS handle it instead of having to click through to get to the folder where it&#039;s at. Also integrating a VPN and ad blocker seems a bit insidious. Opera max is a benefit but still.
Why am I not surprised.

I liked Vivaldi but it still bugs out too often for me. Use Iridium instead.
Nice.
don&#039;t exaggerate, it&#039;s only a web browser by the devs of Opera, based on Blink by Google, which is a fork of Apple&#039;s Webkit, which is a fork of Konqueror&#039;s HTML from the KDE project.
Haven&#039;t even loaded a page with it yet and it literally is unfortunately. Granted I&#039;m using a crappy system at the min and it&#039;s still early day&#039;s for it but not a good start.

it was slow when they just released first builds. Now it is still not perfect, side bar opening/closing still lags, but overall it&#039;s rather fast.
I will switch when they allow me to use the botnet on it. I have way too many synced passwords to quit now.
